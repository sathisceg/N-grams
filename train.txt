the

for

pursing   pursuing   Mec

not

they
will   -   Vt
take
long   a long time   ArtOrDet
period
of

,
requiring

of

.

critics
of
this
proposal
have
pointed
out
that
the

set
aside
for
this
scheme
will
go
to
waste
if
they   the elderly   Others
pass   passed   Vt
away
even
before
they

when
people
get
older
,
it
is
only
natural
that
they
are
more
prone
to
illness
be
it
mentally   mental   Wform
or
physically   physical   Wform

these   This   Pform
permit   permits   SVA
the

to
continue
serving
the   -   ArtOrDet
society
and
also
in
certain
ways

to

however
,
the

beside
the
lack

engineers
are
constrain   constrained   Vform
by

thus
it
comes
as
no

that
governments
around
the   number   Wci

have
stepped
up
their
efforts
to
alleviate
the

the

apart
from
that
,
it
is
well
known
how
corrupted
the

or
is
it
that
it
is
a
must
to
reveal
it
due

and
we

do
not

the

on
the   fashionable   Wform
other
hand
,
apple
has
also
release
its
highly
portable
laptop
called
macbook
pro
which
is
the
thinnest
17-inch
laptop
in
the

.

however
,
the

found
out   that   Wci
this
failed

was
suitable
for
attaching

which
satisfy   satisfied   Vt
many

.

besides
that
,
the

can
also
be
used
to
buy
a
house
,
cover
hospital
expenses
or
for
child   -   Rloc-
's   -   Rloc-
education
fees
.

however
taking
a
look
around
us
today
,
current
research
,
development
and
various
policies
have
evolved
to
an
extent
large
enough
to
dismiss
our   -   Wtone
concerns
with   about   Prep
a
greying
population
.

but
on
the
other
hand
,
not
all
factors
are
within
the
control
of
human
's   -   Wform
capability
.

at
that
point
,
trevor
baylis
came
up
with
the
idea
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
wind-up
radio
,
making
-   the   ArtOrDet
idea
of
broadcasting
education
possible
.

in
addition
to
that
,
the
money
that
is
spent
to   on helping   Wci
help   on helping   Wci
the
elderly
is
partially
their
money
which
was
deducted
through
tax
payment
.

this   However , this   Trans
is
not
true
as
the
vhtr
is
developing
a
passive
heat
removal
system
that
could   can   Vt
achieve
a
higher
level
of
safety
which
is
not
dependent
on
human
's   -   Wform
intervention
.

hence
,
in
future
,
when
migration
issue   issues   Nn
becomes
a
global
pandemic
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
public
should
give
a
helping
hand
to
the
aged
since
the
children
will
no
longer
take
care
of
his   their   Pform
needs
.

an
example
could
be
seen
in
the
following
article   stressesfl   Prep
which   stressesfl   Prep
writes
``
is
n't
the
hdb
's
policies
self-contradictory
,
when
it
's
income
ceiling
policy
'forces
'
the
lower-income
to
buy
larger

than
they
can
afford
...
hdb
's
income
eligibility
requires
a
household
earning
more
than
$
2,000
a
month
to
buy
a
flat
that
is
bigger
than
a
two-room
flat
...
a
household
earning
just
over
$
3,000
,
is
also
not
eligible
to
buy
a
three-room
flat
,
and
have
to
buy
a
four-room
flat
.

thus
,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
either   both   Trans
conventional
technology
or
serendipitous
technology
is   are   SVA
stimulated
by
the
realization
of
problems
and
needs
.

as
the
country
will
have
less   a smaller   Wci
working   work   Wform
force
in
2030
,
the
government
should
invest
more
money
on
education
to
obtain
a
stronger
working   work   Wform
force
to
support
the
country
and
the
large
group
of
elderly
.

judging   Looking at   Wci

in

by

we

the

this

for

in

have
left

this

it

he

how

in

as

any

will
affect

instead

the

this

in

with

thus

reduce   reducing   Vform

by

,
it
actually
adds

and   -   Um

to

the

has
done
well
in
its
foresight

the

but
more

therefore

as
anthony

said
,
a
crucial   foods   Nn
component
for
a
proper

is
defining
the
appropriate
baseline
for
comparison
and
decision
.

this
would
not
only
benefit
the
nation
's
development
but
also
improve
its
people
well-being
.

investing
in
technology
and   aspects   Wci
defence
will
eventually
benefit
everyone
in
singapore
including
the
elderly
and
other
people
in
need
in
terms
of
better
living
condition
and
greater

.

as
an

,
we
should
keep
an

and
we   -   Rloc-
can   -   Vform
not
impede
them
from
what
they
deem
is
the
best
for
themselves
.

however
,
this
growth
is
limited
.

for
instance
,
singapore
needs
to
restructure
the
whole
health
care
system
due
to
the
aging
population
as
singapore   mentioned by the Singapore Prime Minister   WOinc

the

is
679

compared
to

most
thoughts
were
put
into
the
proposal
to
ensure
highest   the   ArtOrDet
level
of
safety
and
security
in
producing
such
a
powerful
reactor
.

hence
vhtr
has
the
potential
to
be
the
main
provider
of
electricity
of   in   Prep
the
future
.

hence
,
with   -   Prep
the
effort
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
singapore
government
to
improve
returns
on
cpf
savings
has
buffered
the
impact
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
problem
.

reports   Thus , reports   Trans
can
be
accessed
by
the
healthcare
professionals
such
as
the
doctors
and
nurses
without
a
hassle
.

one
aspect
is
the
formulating
of
policies
with
the
elderly
in
mind
.

for
example
-   ,   Srun
general
motor
's
electric
car
-   was developed because of the need to meet the requirements of environmentally friendly cars .   Sfrag
.

helium
is
an
inert
gas
,   . Hence   Srun
hence   . Hence   Srun
exposing
it
to
radiation
does
not
make
it
radioactive
-   ,   Mec
thus
averting
a
major
health
hazard.because
of
helium
being
used
as
the
coolant
very
high
temperatures
such
as
1000c
are
possible
-   ,   Mec
thus
increasing
its
efficiency
manifold
.

-   The   ArtOrDet
electrosurgical
device
was
not
invented
until
it
was
realized
that
very
high
frequency
of
current
can
actually
burn
a
tissue
when
the
contact
point
is
relatively
small
.

elderly   The elderly   ArtOrDet
would   could   Vm
use
the
joystick
to
select
their
desired
food
on
the
food
tray
.

while
most
-   products   Others
are
still
in   at the   Wci
prototype
stage
,
the
demand
in
the
market
warrants
such
products
to
be
available
in
the
near
future
.

it
is
true
that
the
policy
forces
a
person
to
save
but
if
this
policy
is
not
in
place
,   prolonged   Wform
it
is
likely
that
one
will
have
to
work
beyond
the
age
of
retirement
.

however
,
in
our
very
own
country
,
malaysia
,
some
problems
have
arisen
in   -   Prep
which
significantly
hamper
the
engineering
design
processes
for
innovation
and
these
have
resulted
in
severe
impact
on
certain
stages
of
the
process
.

lastly
it
is
an   fast-paced   Wci
extremely   fast-paced   Wci
degrading
act
to
a
fellow
human
,
tagging
him
like
a
cattles
in
the
farm
,
and
hence
the
use
of
surveillance
technology
like
rfid
should
be
banned
.

except   Besides   Prep
the
problem
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
safety
,
the   another problem   Wci
second   another problem   Wci
one   another problem   Wci
is
the
cost
.

singapore
's
small
economic
market
and
its
population
holding
a
resistance
to
change
attitude   -   Rloc-
will   -   Vt
have
some
bearing
on
the
engineering
design
processes
for
innovation
.

the
fact
that
china
,
one
the
world
largest
consumers
of
energy
,
is
willing
to
spend
high
proportion
of
money
for
this
project
show   shows   SVA
the
foresee   -   Rloc-
long
run
benefit
that
nuclear
power
can
bring
about
,
especially
since
-   the   ArtOrDet
chinese
government
has
been
always
very
pragmatic
.

one
of
the
proponents
,
james
lovelock
,
has
even
stated
that
nuclear
power
is
the
only
green
solution
for
global
warming
(
james
,
2004
)
.

thus
,
the
emphasis
is
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
county
's
development
so
that
at   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
same   -   Rloc-
time   -   Rloc-
the
country
's
economy
grows   may grow   Vt
,
-   and   Trans
the
people
-   will   Vm
have
a
much
larger
income
to
support
either
themselves
or
their
parents
.

for
example
,
there
are
faster
processors
and
more
internal
memory
space   models   Nn
being
incorporated
.

since
plutonium
-
the
main
substance
in
manufacturing
nuclear
weapon
-
is
not
separated
with
the
nuclear
waste
,
it
can
not
be
easily
extracted
to
build
nuclear
weapons
(
gen-iv   -   Cit
,   -   Cit
2005   -   Cit
)
.

this
will
impact   affect   Wci
all
walks
of
life
,
including
us   ours   Pform
,   -   Rloc-
humans   -   Rloc-
.

however
,
research
has
shown
that
for
many
diseases
like
diabetes
,
kidney
failure
,
heart
diseases
and
so
forth
,
the
chances
of
recovery
are
much
higher
if
the
disease
was   were   Vt
diagnosed
in
the
early
stages
.

in
developed
countries
,
problems
of
aging   their aging population problem   Others
populations   their aging population problem   Others
are
surfacing
and
at
the
same
time
worsening
.

therefore
,
an
aging
population
might
not
posing   pose   Vform
problems
as
feared
.

then
for
the   -   ArtOrDet
msr
about
200
million
dollars
were   have been   Vt
spent
on
safety
testing
.

given
the
current
situation
,
most
of
the
people
in
singapore
would
-   be   V0
able
to
go
beyond
meeting
their
basic
needs
such
as
food
,
shelter
,
water
,
electric
power
supply
-   ,   Mec
sanitation
-   ,   Mec
health
care
and
education
.

however
the
government
also
realises
that
the
cpf
savings
might
not
be
sufficient
for
aging
needs
hence   . Hence ,   Srun
to
help
enhance
the
function
of
cpf
,
the
government
is
adding
an
annuity
scheme
known
as
the
cpf
life
(
lifelong
income
for
the
elderly
)
that
will
provide
a
secure
stream
of
income
for
the
elderly
.   -   Mec

if
the
economy
of
the
country
is
not
growing
,
it
may
affect
the   -   ArtOrDet
businesses
within
the

,
which
in

affects
the
employment

there

these
are
not

only
challenges
that
the   -   ArtOrDet

therefore
,
surveillance

if

for

such
as
that
of

there
exists
the
need
to
recruit
foreign

since
there
is

a

in

if

the

the

however

another

made
when

in

although

last
but
not

,
the   work   Wci

still
needs
gradual

the

so

singapore
is
a

where
the

there

improve
the
overall
health

and
help
them
to

therefore
,
policymakers
need
to
implement
new
policies
to
ensure
that
elderly

enjoy
a
happy
yet
productive
life
even
when

just
like
roger
said
:
in
the   derived   Vt
context
of
the
innovation-development
process
,
the
development
of

may
be
viewed
from
either
a
technologically
determinist
perspective
or
a
socially
determinist
view
,
also
referred

the
social

in
conclusion
,
this
technology
was   is   Vt
independent   free of   Wci
with   free of   Wci
the   -   ArtOrDet
proliferation
risks

hence
-   ,   Mec
a
knowledge
based
economy
will
propel
the
nation
into
societal
development
.

therefore
,
the
two
types
of
technologies
are
alike
since
tough   demanding   Wtone
jobs
are
required
and
researchers
must
be
ready
for
any
consequence
given
by   -   Prep
the
unpredicted   unpredictable   Wform

secondly

to

they

they

also
,

a

hence

the

this
could
be
a
calamitous

accordingly
,
there
exists
a
controversy
that
whether
the

would
have
prevented

the

what

however

there
are

another   -   Um

in

for

it

quite   -   Rloc-

engineering

be
understood

that

it

the

therefore
as

be
easily
put
on
one
's
clothing
which   so   Wci
information
could
be
easily
available
to
marketers
,
government
agencies
and
criminals
.

but
one
thing
is
for
sure
-
our
earth
-   's   Npos
resource
is
depleting
and
engineers
,
being
the
problem
solvers
,
have
to
come
up
with
ideas
to
reduce
fuel
consumption
and
the
risk
of
greenhouse
effect
and
global
warming
.

therefore
,
allowing
more
work   employable   Wci
age   employable   Wci
immigrants
into
the
country
may
be
one
of
the
social
policies
that
can
help
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

when
policies
are
constraints   constrained   Wform
by
a
budget
it   -   Um
aim   -   Um
to   -   Um

after   -   Um
they   -   Um

the   -   Um
public   -   Um
.

it
is
also
an   -   Rloc-
added   -   Rloc-
significant
to
create
a
barrier-free
environment
for
the
increasing
ageing
population
in
singapore
.

in
recent
years
however
,
it
has
branched
out
into
a
video
analysis
application
scans
streams
from   treat   Mec
in-home
cameras
and
detects
when
someone
has
fallen
and
automatically
notifies
kin
and
emergency
services
if
necessary
.

an
aging
population
will
have
a
serious
consequence
on
health
issues
in
developed
nations
in   because   Wci
the   because   Wci
view   because   Wci
that   because   Wci
more
medical
support
will
be
needed
by
the
elderly
.

on
the
contrary
,
the
elderly
need
the
government
to
support
them
and
the
government   abandoning   Vform
should
do
so
.

providing
for
the
aged
will
therefore
hinder
the
nation
's
overall
development
in
other
aspects   the current high cost of living   Wci
.   the current high cost of living   Wci

president

paul
m.
brown
claims
that
they
have
a
technology
to
make
the
nuclear
waste
a
safe
energy
by
burning
it
.

in
addition
to   -   Rloc-
that   -   Rloc-
,
some
of
these
stations
like
city

and
dhoby
ghaut
station
,
not
only
play
the
role
of
an
important
hub
in
singapore
's
transport
system
,
but
also
an
internal
shopping
center
within
itself
.

however
,
i
think
that
the
benefits
of
such
surveillance
technologies
outweigh
its   the cost   ArtOrDet
cost
of
intruding
human
's
privacy
.

singapore
,
a
small
country
has
only
650
square
kilometers
of
land
area   is   SVA
.

he
can
also
decide
not
to
tell
his
family
members
if
he
thinks
that   -   ArtOrDet
they
might
not
be
able
to
cope
with
the
news
emotionally
.

it
will
also
cause
many
people
in
the
family
tree
-   to   Vform
suffer
from
this
disease
.

i
acknowledge
the
importance
of
essential
healthcare
,
housing
and
retirement
living
expenses
being
subsidised
-   in   Others
by
public
pensions
.

and
because
we
know
very
clearly
that
it
is
dangerous
,
we
devote
very
much
effort
to
monitor
the
whole
process
in
case
accident   accidents   Nn
happens   happen   SVA
.

nowadays
,
people
have   are   Vt
been   are   Vt
more
health
conscious
than   -   Rloc-
before   -   Rloc-
.

in
order
to
make
the

to   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
much
less
-   attractive   Wci
of
being
a
target
by
the
terrorist
point
of
view
,
funding
for
research
and
development
will
help
to
look
for
simpler
safety
interlock
systems
and
other
materials
which
can
withstand
very
high
temperature
to
built
the
reactor
.

then   Consequently   Trans
,
the
reactor
started
getting
out
of
control
.

but
are
they
allowed
to
inform
their
own
condition
to
family
members
who
are
also
at
exposure
risk
?

actually
,
the
tragedy
can
be
attributed
to
the
flawed
emergency
operation
procedures
instead
.

by
comparing
the
total
mark
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
different
plans
,
they
decide
-   on   Prep
the
final
plan
.

public
spending
on
the
aged
should
thus
be
limited
so
that
money
can
be
diverted
to
areas
such
as
economic
,   -   Cit
defence   -   Cit
,
education
and
infrastructure
in
order
for
the
country
to
develop
healthily
.

firstly
,
many
people
opposed   oppose   Vt
the
use
of
nuclear
power
as
a
form
of
energy
because
it
is
expensive
to
research
and
build
a   -   Rloc-
nuclear   -   Rloc-
reactor   -   Rloc-
.

this
will
cause
humiliation   until   Others
,   until   Others
especially
when
he/she
is
a
professional
,
like
an
athlete
.

as
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
united
states
government
,
they
divide
the
spending
to
five
sectors
,
which
are
pensions   pension   Nn
,
health
,
education
,
welfare
and
defense   defence   Mec
.

although
it
produces
-   a   ArtOrDet
large
amount
of
radioactive
wastes
,
as   if   Trans
long   if   Trans
as   if   Trans
the
hybrid
reactor
could
be
produced
,
the
wastes
would
not
be
a
problem
.

some
people
argue
that
the
reprocessing
of
waste
is   -   ArtOrDet
unsafe
.

(

robert

by   Because of   Trans
this
,
the

will
not
need
to

retirement

in
this
program
,
the
government
has
set
aside
$
40
million
into
the
accessibility
fund
so
as
to
encourage
owners
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
buildings
to
provide
accessibility
features
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
existing
or
new
buildings
.

lastly
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
education
system
must
be
reviewed
in
order
to
solve
such
challenges
and
bring
us
a
new
generation
of
engineers
who
are
able
to
devise
innovations
guided
by
the
perspectives
of
a
true
designer
.

after
converting
the   a   ArtOrDet
new
technology
into
useful   a useful product   Spar
products   a useful product   Spar
,   -   Rloc-
it   -   Rloc-
comes
to   -   Prep
the
process
of
marketing
.

if
there   -   Rloc-
is   -   Rloc-
no
one
wants
to
accept
a
new
creative   -   Rloc-
product
,
it
will
be
hard
for
it
to
exist
in
the
market
and
-   this   Sfrag
will
also
deter
people
to   from participating   Wci
participate   from participating   Wci
in
the
engineering
design
process
for
innovations
.

without
the
knowledge
of
the
characteristics
of
different
materials
,
one
will
not
be
able
to
choose
the
best
material
,
which
must
be
strong
yet
light
in
weight
,
to
be
use   used   Vform
.

in
comparison
with
the
vhtr
,
i
feel
-   the   ArtOrDet
lfr
has
more
advantages
and
-   is   V0
a
better
reactor
design
and
thus
deserves
greater   more   Wci
research
.

this
is
because
over
the
years
-   ,   Mec
singaporeans
are   have been   Vt
encouraged
and
educated
to
be
financially
independent
,
self-reliant
and
-   to   Spar
plan
for
their
old-age
-   ,   Mec
so
as
not
to
be
overly
dependent
on
the
government
.

in
conclusion
,
although
each
uptick
in
protection
will
typically
come
at
the
cost
of
more
intrusion
into
the
privacy
of
ordinary
people
,
-   the development of   Um
surveillance
technology
has
come
up
with
the
best
possible
inventions
to
assure
that
this
trade-off
will
be
worth
it
.

moreover   Allowing   Trans

that

however
,
as

there

since

health

is
capped
at

therefore
the

it

a
substantial
percentage
of

still
suffering
from

in

have
posted   posed   Wci
doubts

firstly
,
using
solar
cars
could
effectively   part   Mec
reduce
the

of

,
especially
carbon

most
importantly
,
planning
for
old

age
is
a
long-term
goal

hence
,
that
individual
should
inform

to
advise   technologies   Wform
them
to
take
genetic
testing

which

that
means
sfr

able

meet

process
places
a

high
demand
on

creativity

which
is
closely
related
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
thinking

as
english

a
complusary
course
to
learn
in

,
-   the   ArtOrDet

in

the

have
to

birth   The birth   ArtOrDet
of
these
two
types
of

had
very
similar
causes

such
as
pressure

the

this

such

the

the

three

points
can
be

to   -   Um

this

both
of

two
methods
require
tough

their

overcome
the
impacts

although
this
feature
does
not
really
decrease
the
chance
of

zero
,
it
does
complicate
the
means
to
try
to
reprocess
them

as
rfid

are
rewritable

if   -   Rloc-

there

finally
,
it
is
costly

as
unnecessary
to

there
are
also
some
similarities

these

.

it
is
nearly   -   Rloc-

this

had   has   Vt
also
resulted

with
the
development
of
the

,   -   Prep
the
technological
innovation
has
been
continuously
influenced

several
factors
primarily
in

.

in
conclusion
,
i
believe
that
the
usage
of

in
tracking

should
not
be
banned
as
the

also
,
the

he

thus

the

share

however
,
some
people
insist
that
the
government
should
take
the   -   ArtOrDet
responsibility
to   in   Wci
look   looking   Vform
after
the

people
by
increasing

furthermore
,
if

then
focus

but
,
like
many

not
have

nevertheless   However   Trans

for

they
show

however
,
as
argued

everybody

ever

is

the   Another   Wci

important

during
the
nine-year
development
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
camera
phone
technology
,
we
can
see
that
the   -   Rloc-
great   -   Rloc-
market
demand
,
customer
requirement
,
and
government
regulations
of   -   Rloc-
different   -   Rloc-
countries   -   Rloc-
have
once   -   Rloc-
affected
this
technology
a
lot
.

as
a
result
,
later
retirement
is
encouraged
by
government   governments   Nn
from
many
countries
.

i
think
there
are
two
primary
reasons
,
high
costs
in
engineering
design
with
relatively
low
rewards
and
-   an   Vt
unsatisfying
engineering
education
system
.

this
is
due
to
incurring   increasing   Wci
costs   expenses for   Wci
from   expenses for   Wci
the

the
vhtr
is
a
clean
source
of
energy
and
could
be
the
solution
to
the
energy
crisis
.

thus
spending
on
the
aged
is
necessary
yet   , however ,   Trans
it
should
be
carefully
limited
so
as
not
to
compromise
other
sectors
and
overall
national
interest
in
the
long
run
.

furthermore
,
limiting
public
spending
on
the
aged
is
not
an
easy
task
.

plus   Moreover   Trans
,
the
earliest
delivery
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
sodium-cooled
reactor
is
10
years
earlier
than
-   the   ArtOrDet
lead-cooled

the   Furthermore   Trans

,
the
rate
of
poverty
will
be
smaller   lower   Wci

another
major
issue
caused
by
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
population
is
the
increasing
healthcare
problem
associated
with

elderly
.

with
a

investing
in
'green
'
technology
would
not
only
ensure
that
we
will
have
a
steady
supply
of
energy
to
develop
our
economy
but
it
could
also
be
another
source
of
revenue
for
countries
developing
such
technologies
-   ;   Mec
and
some
analysts
has   have   SVA
estimated
that
this
industry
could
potentially
be
worth
up
to
us
$
4
trillion
.

the
first
way
is
to
design
a
system
to   toilets   Nn
recycle
used
water
.

according
to
wilpert
(
2007
)
,
the
designer
's
and
the
user
's
conceptual
model
of
a
system
or
a
device
must
be
matched
in
order
to
reduce
the
problems   -   Vt
that
might
have
occurred
during
the
time
of
using
it
,
in
this
case
,
the
train
.

despite   In   Wci
the   an   ArtOrDet
economic
downturn
,
the
government
could
use
money   -   Rloc-
from   -   Rloc-
their
reserve
fund   funds   Nn
instead
.

secondly
,
discrimination
from
the
relatives   one 's   Spar
affects
the
carrier
's
decision
in
revealing
his
condition
.

for
example
,
the
public
assistance
program
can
provide
the
elderly
a
-   ,   Mec
sense
of
security
for
food
,
shelter
and
daily
necessities
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
should
not
be
banned
because
it
not
only
improve   improves   SVA
security
system
for
people
and
country
but
also
enhance   enhances   SVA
the
healthcare
sector
.

to
minimize
the
fear
among
this
increasing
group
of
people
,
research
and
development
in
areas
such
as
medicine
and   hormone   Nn
technology
and
social
policies
supported
by
the
government
have
helped
to
a
very
large
extent
to
ease
the
aging
process
,
be
it
physically
,
emotionally
or
socially
.

however
,
the
savings
only
amount
to
roughly   -   Rloc-
about
10-15
%
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
final
cost
of

these

further
reduce

the

with

another

the

the

not

to
overcome
the
current

for

,
the   -   ArtOrDet
insurance

in
conclusion
,
coal

oil
are
no
longer
sources
of
energy
that
we
should
rely
on
because
of
their
rising
costs
and
environmental

.

the
boom
of
innovation
and

in
the
past
few
decades
has
just   -   Wtone
been
tremendous
.

therefore
,
the
opponent
's
argument
does
not
stand
.

in

,
with   still having   V0

a

,
these

to

economy
.

public

have
steps-free

and

for

of
the

.

some
may
argue
that
the
old   -   Rloc-
aged
need
more
money
as
they
are
unable
to
earn
income
to
support
their

.

besides
,
the

nuclear

its

therefore
relatively

.

hence
,
government

is
important
to

in

,
some
countries
,
such
as

have
begun
to
implement
this
policy

i
would
give
my
fullest
support
for
the
concept
of

among
the
six
concepts
proposed
in

iv

-   the   ArtOrDet

research

showed
that
living

in
their
journey
of
conquering
new
physical

challenges
(

.

hence
we
should
spend
on
other
developments
but
not
to   at   Prep
the
expense
of
forgoing
that
for
the
elderly
.

some
people
may
argue
that
if
a
carrier
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
known
genetic
risk
tells
his
or
her
relatives
about
the
risk
,
he
or

will
be
abandoned
by
families
.

human

actions
are
involved
in

(

.

the
view
that
support
the
use
of
psychology
could
have
prevented
the

shows   experience   Nn
that
the
design
errors
directly
cause
the

and
removing
these
errors
would
remove

.

the   -   ArtOrDet
people
may
not
work
more
despite
the
fact
that
they
became

hence

that

in
conclusion
,
research

development
and
policies

help
to

is
relative   relatively   Wform
important

the

it
is
also
important
to
implement
measures
that
require
people
to
rely
on
oneself
rather
than
-   the   ArtOrDet

.

critics
may
argue
that
the   -   ArtOrDet

should

for

for

western

planning

firstly
,
-   a   ArtOrDet
nuclear
power
plant
is
more
cost
effective
-   to operate   V0
as
compared
to
other

sources
.

therefore
,
due
to
these
worries
,
many
couples

are
not
responding

despite
the
continuous

the   -   ArtOrDet

would
be
an

model
to
supply
nuclear

to

problems
.

thirdly
,
the
challenge
faced
by
the
countries
to
isolate
the
leftover

highly
radioactive
material
discharged   nuclear   Mec
by

is
also
a
main
reason
why
it
is

the

so

the

of

that   and   Ssub
they

after

,
what
can
a

bring
to

limiting

especially
for

in
a

,
science

has

by
improving

there

in

try
to

in

however

this

that

lastly
,
the
potential

of

would
definitely
be
valuable
for
the

in

,
a

there
is

the
first
factor
related   relates   Vt
to
people
-   's   Npos
misunderstands
of
effect
of
their
action
on
the
whole
system
,
and
the
second
factor
is
kind
of
persistent
action
which
is
made
by
a
small
and
cohesive
group
in
the
process
of
pursuing
an
unsuitable
aim
.

videophone
users
also
commonly
look
at
the
video
screen
and
not
at
the
video
camera
,
causing   videophones   Nn
the
eyes
to
take
on
an
unnatural
awkward
glance
,
as
the
camera
is
usually
just
positioned
away
from
the
screen
(
``

)
.

other
than
that
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
interim
disability
assistance
programme
for
the
elderly
(
idape
)
and
primary
care
partnership
(
pcps
)
are
other
subsidy
schemes
available
.

although
most
of
the
children
today
have
mobile
phones
,
it
is
also
possible
that
their
mobile
phones
are
lost
or
they
are   have   Vt
having   have   Vt
difficulties
to

it
is
no
doubt
that
future
prosperity
is
likely
to
be
negatively
affected
because
-   of   Prep
the
lack
of
investment
in
education
,
nutrition
and
other
aspects
for
young
generations
.

moreover
,
surveillance
technology
is
vital
in
ensuring
the
safety
of

this
procedure
is
extremely
efficient
so
much
so
that
one
pound
of
uranium
produces
20,000
times
more
energy
compared
to
a   -   ArtOrDet
one

coal
.

another
example
is
the
doorbell

which
flashes

these
are
just
examples
of
the
many
strategies
that
the
government
has
come
out   up   Wci
with
to
ease
the
aging
process
in
singapore
.

recently   Recent studies have   Srun

the

(
bryan
,

)
.

in
contrast
,
by
creating
policies
to
boost
productivity
of
the
workforce
,
the
government
would
firstly
have
to
set
aside
resources
for
upgrading
and
incentive   incentives   Nn
,
posing
more
potential
of
cutting
welfare
programs
of
the
aged
to
fund
the
new
regime
.

all
this   these   ArtOrDet
-   would   Vm
incur
more
costs
.

rather
,
developing
high
technology
and
taking
proper
safety
precaution
when
the   an   ArtOrDet
accident
happened   happens   Vt
are
more
important
.

and
such
training
is
``

to
improve
mental
agility
,
slow
the
onset
of

and
alzheimer

as
mentioned
by
friedland
and
summer
(
2005
)
in
``
doomsday
predictions
about
population
aging
are
exaggerated
''
,
with
little
economic
growth   es aboutho   Prep
,
there
are
fewer
choices
on
how
to
care
for
the
elderly
thus
intensifying
the
problem
on
hand
.

meanwhile
,
some
engineers
at
rockwell
international
also
noticed
that
a
significant
amount
of
ice
-   had   Vt
built
up
on
the
fixed
service
structure
that
stood
beside
the
shuttle
.

(
kunz
,
2007
)
-   .   Cit
another
method
to
increase
the   -   ArtOrDet
workforce
productivity
is
to
invite
foreign
talents
and
immigrants
to
stay
and
work
,   -   Mec
in
order
to
counter
the
low
birth
rate
of
the   a   ArtOrDet
country
.

it
also
facilitates
the   -   ArtOrDet
driving
within
singapore
by
making
it
smoother
and
providing
alternatives
road   roads ,   Nn
which
were
lesser
as
compared
to
the
past
.

hence
,
the
government
is
paying
more
attention
to
solve   solving   Vform
these
problems
caused
by
aging
population
through
various
means
.

in
addition
,
adding
a
motion
sensor
system
to
provide
a
daily
update
of
the
elderly
can
help
bring
peace
of
mind
to
distant
relatives
who
are
concerned
about
the
safety
of
their
elderly
family
members
who
might
be
injured
or
ill
and
-   ,   Mec
worse
of
all
;   ,   Mec
unable
to
call
for
help
.

besides
,
feature   features   Nn
such
as

however
,
if

eco-car
is
to
proceed
on   -   Rloc-
with   to   Prep
the
commercialization
stage
in
the
engineering
design
process
,
the
problem
encountered
by
my
home
country
is
the   -   ArtOrDet
capital
cost
.

so   Thus   Trans
,
the
possibility
of
explosion
due
to
the
very
high
temperature
becomes
extremely
low
.

a
larger
and
efficient
workforce
will   reimbursing   Vform
be
good
news
for
the
civil
service
and
private
sector
.

in
conclusion
,
public
spending
should
not
be
diverted
to
other
areas
such
as
,   -   Mec
education
and
generating   generation   Spar

for
instance
,
in
singapore
the
elevators
in
an   -   ArtOrDet
older
hdb
flat   flats   Nn
can
only
stop
at
certain
levels
.

firstly
,
in
the
rbmk
reactor
,
the
process
of
insertion
of   eliminate   Vt
rods
,
which
are
to
regulate
the
reaction
speed
,
is
inefficient
and
there
is
no
fast
rod
for
emergency
.

therefore
in   employs   SVA
my
opinion
,
vhtr
is
rated
better
only
in
terms
of
physical
protection
and
performance
as
compared
to
sfr
.

managers
want
their
employees
'
location
at

,
retailers
need
information   -   ArtOrDet
of
customers
in
the
store
and
policeman
need
identification
of
the
suspicious
at
the
spot
.

therefore
,
action
should
be
taken
to
prevent
further
corruption
in
politic   the political   WOinc
system
so
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
engineering
design
process
would

not
only
are
the
elderly
hindering
the   a   ArtOrDet
country
's
economic
growth
,
they
are
depleting
it
at
an
alarming
rate
as
well
.

if
they
limit   limited   Vt
the
amount
being
spent
on
the

they
can
use
their

to

the

the

the

this
is

this

clearly

why

many

a

option
to
effectively
improve

for

,
the

due
to

the

neglected
the

finally   -   Rloc-

conclude
,
due
to
the   -   Rloc-

of   -   Rloc-
a

,
various   -   Rloc-

the

.

finally
testing
and

,
you
have
to
test
all
steps
in
the
process

for

,

expected

and
when

the

the

some

the

the

can
not

the
huge

it

another
factor

another
rationale
behind
the   -   ArtOrDet
protests
against

that
it

alternative

besides
,
the

produce

also
hydrogen

it
is
less
effective
because
-   the   ArtOrDet
benefits
do
not
exceed
the
cost
.

the
psychology
behind
this
is
that
the
workers

built
the

no

consequences

one
of

reasons

encouraging

by
extending

helps
to
reduce

(

.

this
trend
suggests
that
singapore
is
confronted
with

the
problem
of
a
rapidly

this

always

some
feel
that
giving

full
support
to

is
of
the
utmost
importance
while
others
suggest
limiting

on
the

drawing   being conscious of   Wci
concerns
from

sectors
of

such
as
economic
growth
and
sustainability
.

since
everything
provided
by
-   the   ArtOrDet
the
government
is
considered
as
a
right
of
people
,
the
more
subsidies
for
the

,
the
more
demand
will
be
created
.

but
the
economic
rent
of

does
not

depend
on
the
cost   while   Trans
to
build
the
plant
,
but
also
depends
on
the
efficiency
of

.

the
elders   elderly   Wform
should
benefit
from
the   -   ArtOrDet
government
,
family
and
community
care
in
all
aspects
to
help

after
what

done
for

over

therefore
in

it

the   These   Pref

however

those

that

(

.

this
would

lead
to
a

as
the

do
not
feel

with
the

the

this

reduce

in

in
my

in

we

so
,
the
manufacture

for

,
the

the   -   ArtOrDet

,
is
one

public

been
increasing

which
results

furthermore

due

but
for
convention
,
its   smoothly   Wci

often
regarded

as
the

since

the

the

so   -   Rloc-
therefore   Therefore   Mec

in
order
to
be
a
valid
candidate
for
an
explanation
of

,
the

proposed
by

must
meet
the
following
criteria
:
(

)
they

commonly
occur
in

(

)
as

these

and
(

the

government

with

they

a

with

background
will
find
it
hard
to
compete
with
other
foreign

with

,
thus
losing
out
when
it
comes
to
employment
and
resulting
in
a
huge
percentage
of
the
population
being
unemployed
.

the
u.s.

20

now   power.To date ,   Wci
we
have
come
up
with
6
concepts
for
the
generation-iv
reactors
,
which
mean
to
produce
more
reliable
energy
at
lower
cost
and
risk
.

during
-   an   ArtOrDet
operation
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
condition
of

patient

remain   is   Wci
unforeseeable   unpredictable   Wci
;
there   -   Rloc-

and
decisions
needed   need   Vt
to
be
made
between   involving   Wci
the
surgeon
,
the
nurses
and
the
robotic
system
.

the
fear
of
using
nuclear
reactors
as
a
cover
up
for
making
-   an   ArtOrDet
nuclear
bomb
is
even
more
prominent
.

therefore
,
students
are
satisfied
in
using
one
way
to
solve
-   a   ArtOrDet
problem
.

such
-   a   ArtOrDet
scheme
is
unpractical   impractical   Mec
even
-   if   Trans
it
may
work
in
the
long
run
.

on
top
of
that
,
most
importantly
,
they
had   have   Vt
contributed
to
the
nation
by
imparting
their
knowledge
and
experience
with   to   Prep
the
younger
generation
.

most
people
choose
to
hire
a
translator
.

however
,
some
people
may
think
that
the
aged
is
a
burden
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
society
as
they
believe
that
the
physical
condition
of
the
aged
can
not
keep   cope   Wci
pace   cope   Wci
with
the
development
of
the
country
.

due
to
the
fact
that
older
patients
are
more
prone
to
hospital
admittances
than
the   -   ArtOrDet
other
age
groups
,
providing
better
medical
care
facilities
and
services
not
only
helps
to
reduce
the
chance
of
re-admission
,
it
will
also
facilitate
better
chances
of
making
a
full
recovery
.

these

as

the

to

the

the

due

for

as

hence

if

according

these

the

the

in

there

the

has
entrench   made   Wci
singapore

although
the

comparably

,
the
conditions
where
they
were

maybe   may be   Vm
totally

however

that

the

so

as   In   Wci
a   In   Wci
conclusion
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the

be
limited

so
that

ts   -   Um

firstly
,

that

in

since

and
developing

which
could
greatly
accelerate

in
the

in
addition
,
helium
does
not
go
through
any
phase
change
at
or
over
reactor
operating
temperature
;
this
will
improve
the   -   ArtOrDet
safety
because
the
design
and
operation
is   are   SVA
being
simplified
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
it
would
be
wiser
for
the
governments
of
such
countries
to
find   craft   Wci
other
policies
that
would
suit
their
own
needs
.

however
,
people
might
argue
that
the
aged
has   have   SVA
their
children
to
depend
on

but
this
dependence
is
straining
on

as

however

the

what

however
,
with
a
limited
budget
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
is
not
capable
of
covering
all
expenses
.

the
united

reactors
now
have
the
safety
standard
of
1   -   ArtOrDet
in

,
much
better
than

for

,
even
though
the

is
much
higher
than

,
many

the
use
of
radio

is
governed
by
strict

with
the
development
of
science
and
technology
,
the
swcr
will
not
only
be
able
to
efficiently
produce
clean
energy
but
also
significantly
settle   address   Wci
the
severe
global

challenge
today
.

this
is
partially
due
to
the
reason
that
vhtr
's
coolant
,
helium
gas
-   ,   Mec
is
much
most   more   Wform
costly
than

and
because
of

it

many
who
bought

are
complaining
especially
about

hence
,
governments
should
encourage

to

responsibility
for
taking
care
of
their
elder   elderly   Wform
parents
,
through
social
awareness
campaigns
.

one
of
the
opposing

was

are
all

however
-   ,   Mec
there
is
a
study
-   that   Ssub
can
disprove
it
.

first
and
foremost
,
the
progress
of
technology
increases
the
country
-   's   Npos
income
so
that
the
country
can
take
better
care
of
the
elderly
.

however
,
in   as   Prep
evident
of   from   Prep
the
above
policies
,
singapore
was
the
only
asian
country
which
won
the
aarp
international
innovative
employer
award
(
yap
,
2009
)
.

these
people
are
not
only
helping
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
to
cut
down
expenditures
on
health
care
,
but
also
helping
countries   the country   ArtOrDet

only
so   -   Rloc-
can   then can   WOinc
then   then can   WOinc
the
other
problems
arising
from
an
ageing
population
be
resolved
simultaneously
.

the
next
factor
contributing
to
the
aging
phenomenon
is
the
declining
of
birth
rates
as
people
tend
to
have
lesser   fewer   Wci
kids
than
-   in   Prep
the
previous
years
.

if
we
maximize
the
effect

warming   warming   Mec
,
all
the   -   ArtOrDet
life

extinct
eventually
.

using
eco-
friendly
cars
would
reduce
the
carbon
emissions
per
car
drastically
.

thus
for   the   ArtOrDet
those   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
that
only
understand

will
not
have   get the message   Wci

thereby
defeats   defeating   Vform
the
purpose
of

.

if
the
arrangements
of
products
and
instructions
are
incomprehensible
and
complicated
,
purchasers
will
be
confused
when
using
these
gadgets
.   -   Rloc-

consequently
,
they
help
prevent
formation
of

munro

i

policies
need
to
be
developed
that
account
for
the
natural
incentives
individuals
have
to
adjust
their
behaviour
in
the
face
of
-   an   ArtOrDet
aging
population
.

the
mindset
of
respecting
those
who
built
the
country
from
scratch
resonates
with
feeling
indebted
to
take
care
of
them
when
-   they are   Pref
old
and
providing
them
with
the
best
of
health-care
.

(

the

another
area

is
highly
influential

affecting

related
industries
such
as

the
government
should
not
use
aging   the ageing   ArtOrDet
population
as
a
reason
to
limit
public
spending
as
they
always
encourage
productive
and
healthy
living
for
the
elderly
people
.

moreover
,
new
inventions
should
not
be
the
only
products
with
a
``

green
''
factor
as
old
inventions
can
be
revised
in
order
to
cohere
to
the
``

another
case

is

to
be

,
there
is
never
a

,
but

this
includes
lengthening

by

they

but
again
,
if

they

to

china

however

on

as

hence

another

in

there

on

the

will

a

from
the
angle
of

,
many
people
are
afraid
of
the
hypothesis
that
terrorists
may
attack
the

because
they
are
the

however
,
conservation

the

ignored

then   Moreover   Trans
,
as

privacy

it

the

the
engineers
have
to
be

understand
the
improvements   normality   Wci
their

however
,
these

can
be
addressed
by
counseling

moral
support
from

the
medical

that

however
,
high
living

make

therefore

among

while
some
might

that
there

however

all

the

the

these

so
it
is
no   not   Mec
more   -   Rloc-
surprising
that
the
two

both
become
very
popular
among
the
consumers
as
soon
as

.

therefore
,
the
public
should
continue
to
provide
for

this
design
was
welcomed
by
most   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
the

and
the
whole

was
carefully
carried

the

should
not
be
totally
banned
but
more

should
be
imposed
and
more

be
invested
in

the

of
this

.

nevertheless
,
once
a
main
accident
in

occurs
,
the
impact
will
be
enormous
,
long

and
wide

while

the

what

every
policymaker
needs
to
consider   pension   Nn
the
effects
of
their
proposed
policies
on
this
issue
thoroughly
before
implementing
.

in
conclusion
,
coping
with
an
aging
population
will
require
a
long
time   term   Wci
effort
and
it
is
a
challenge
to
a
country
.

first
,
it
harms
the
healthy
part
of
the
patient
,
which
means   a   ArtOrDet
the
patient
would
get
injured
again
at
another
place
.

it
will
also
be
harder
for
them   -   Pform
to
acquire
new
skills
that
can
benefit
some   industry   Nn
industries   industry   Nn
.

however   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
there   -   Rloc-
are   -   Rloc-
some   -   Rloc-
people
who
state
that
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
,
so
that
the
money
can
be
spent
on
other
areas
.

for
instance
,
if
we
want
to
design
a
race
car
,
we
need
some
highly
technology   technological   Wform
instruments
to
do
researches   research   Nn
on
the   -   ArtOrDet
car
engine   engines   Nn
and
other
parts
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
car
.

besides
constructing
roads
,
governments
give   gave   Vt
tax
rebates
to
companies
that
are   were   Vt
heavily
involves   involved   Vt
in
research
and
development
projects
.

with
-   the   ArtOrDet
lack
of
advertising
,
their
products
were
poorly
accepted
in
the
market
.

in
this
stage
,
the
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
discoveries
turns   turned   Vt
to
be
that
the
serendipitous
discovery
's
inventor
could
not
meet
his
initial
needs
like
the
normal
inventor
but
accidently
create
a
totally
different
product
instead
.

as
mentioned
,
skunkworks
are   -   Vt
always
lack
of   -   Prep
resources
,
which   -   Um
funding   -   Um
ranked   -   Um
first   -   Um
out   -   Um
of   -   Um
others   -   Um
.

it   The goal of limiting public spending on the aged   Pref
will
be
made
possible
if
these   the proposed measures   Pref
are
strongly
enforced
,
and
high
cooperation
among
citizens
of
our
society
will
help
to
deal
with
this
issue
too
.

in
singapore
,
the
government
intends
to
rise   raise   Wci
the
retirement
age
of
the
working
group
to
62
so
that
the
elderly
can
continue
to
support
themselves
financially
.

technically
,
it
is
possible
to
avoid
a
meltdown
given
that
the
new
generation
iv
has
an
advanced   the   ArtOrDet
safety
system
in
place
.

the
word
aging
has
always
been
a   greatly   Wform
great   greatly   Wform
fear   feared   Wform
for   by   Prep
most
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
society
.

however
,
the
results
of
the
recent
national
innovation
system
(
nis
)
survey
show
that
singapore
has
a
long
way
to
go
in
its   prevent   Vform
development
of
an
innovation-based
economy
,
especially
in
comparison
to
the
other
oecd
countries
.

with
the
expansion
of
science
,
nothing
seems
hard
to
imagine
and
we
have
the
right
of   to   Prep
hoping   hope   Vform
such
world
would
become   come into existence   Wci

.

to   -   Um
date   -   Um
,   -   Um
these   -   Um
three   -   Um
areas   -   Um
are   -   Um
highly   -   Um
subsidized   -   Um
and   -   Um
funded   -   Um
.   -   Um

such
worry
-   the   ArtOrDet
is
unfounded
.

it
creates
a
cohesive
-   's   Npos
community
where
the
elderly
can
integrate
themselves
into
the
society
through
participating
in
various
social
activities
.

to
conclude
,
i   -   Wtone
just   -   Wtone
want   -   Wtone
to   -   Wtone
emphasize   -   Wtone
that   -   Wtone
technology
depends
on
social
factors
.

if   -   Rloc-
any   -   Rloc-

that

that
he

the

had

.

member

and
with
economic
growth
,
the
country
becomes   will become   Vt

and
the

according

for

singapore
need   needs   SVA
to
develop

own

,   ;   Srun
thus
we
need
foreign

like
accomplished

who
can
lead
us
into
the

of

with
their

and

.

even
though
that   this   ArtOrDet
is
a

,

has

anyway   In any case   Wtone
,
both

improved

another
strategy
that

would
be
to
emphasize

and
encourage
the
willingness
of

,
so
as
to

what
is
more
,
we
should
look
at

problem
in   over   Prep
the
long
term
.

-   The   ArtOrDet
titanic
was
equipped
with
only
20
lifeboats
,
so
that
bulky
lifeboats
would
not
take
up

for

.

i
think
it
is
necessary
and
feasible
to
build
vhtr
to
solve
-   our   Pref
energy
issues   problems   Wci
,
although
some
people
hold
opposite
ideas
.

one
of
the
main
causes
-   for   Trans
of
growing
aging
population
is
the
low
fertility
rate
in
singapore
.

even
though
the
collapse
of
the
walkway
is   was   Vt
due
to
the
failure
of
components
of
the
structure
,
it
would
not
have
been
fatal
if
the
errors
was   were   SVA
identified
and
corrected
in
time
.

and
out
of
the
34
tests
,
22
can   could   Vt
cause
a
serious
problem
to
the

(

.

hence
,
advancement
in
technology
has
increased
the
efficiency
of

thus
,
easing
the

however
,
in
terms

,
sodium
itself
is
a   -   ArtOrDet
very
reactive
and
any
leakage
during
an
accident
will
put
the
plant
operators
at
risk
.

a
good
government
will
come
out
with
a
clear
policy
to
help
its

along

such
that

the

and
if

the

one
may

resulting

in

there

public

should
be

to

for
all
nations
,
wise
planning
on
public
spending
and
wise
policy
planning
are
very
crucial
as
they
influence
one
's
future
.

when
a
country
like
the

an

personal
assistance
for
the

.   -   Rloc-

first
,
it
is
a
social
obligation
to
provide
for
the
seniors
.

if
individuals
do
not
have
the
final
say
-   in revealing genetic test results   Others
,
their
family
members
will
know
their
condition
,
and
they
can
be
more
sensitive
to
the
individual
's
feelings
,
-   such as   Trans
giving
them
better
support
and
encouragement
.

such
increase
in
longevity
and
the
reduce
in
birth
rates
,
will
no
doubt
lead
to
an
inevitable
rise
to
the
problems
of
aging
,
as
there
are
fewer
and
fewer
young
people
to
support
the
rising
number
of
elderly
,
whether   both   Wci
financially
or   and/   Trans
socially
.

in
fact
,
it
did
not
happen
as
expected
;
the
power
increased
dramatically
and
-   an   ArtOrDet
explosion
occurred
.

besides
that
,
the
export
rate
of
malaysia
's
product   products   Nn
would
also
be
heavily
affected
,
such
as
the
automobile
sector
,
as
it
would
slowly
be
outclassed
by
other
innovative
products
from
other
country   countries   Nn
.

according
to

international

(

worldwide

increase

per

and
will

by
the

.

thus
,
the
government
has
to
prioritize
and
allocate
our   -   Wtone
resources
wisely
so
that

however
,
just   broad   Wci

there
are
many
engineering

countries

no

the

firstly
,
expenditure
should
be
placed
more
on
the

itself
because
with
economic
growth
,
the
working
population
-   the   ArtOrDet
will
be
more
self-sustainable
and
be
able
to
support
themselves
when
they
retire

however
,
other
than
directly
diverting
the   the Government   ArtOrDet
money
on
the

,
there
are
other
ways
to
resolve
these

however

there

in

is
the

that
meets
the
level
1
safety
criterion
,
which
means
that
it
is
immune
to
major
structural
failure
and
operator
error
.

therefore
,
these
areas
of
development
must
be
well
invested
-   in   Wci
.

according
to
a
definition
on
the
wikipedia
website
,
-   reasons for an   Sfrag

,
of   -   SVA
which   -   SVA
three   -   SVA

is   which   WOadv
the   which   WOadv

of
all
the
aspects
of

,
appearance
and

weigh
the
most

however

the

be
able
to
produce
50
%
more
energy
with
the

amount
of
fuel
(

)
.

therefore
,
countries
should
support
further
research
and
development
funding
for
the
very-high-temperature
reactor
.

educational
institutions
provide
quality

teaching
while

impart

that

being
prudent
,
singaporeans
tends   tend   Rloc-
to
be
less

compared
to
their
western

.

in
conclusion
,
though
there
are
many
differences
between
the
discovery
of
the
laptop
and
-   that of the   Spar
pacemaker
shown
above
,
they
both
help
to
propel
the
human
race
forward
into
the

.

therefore
,
continuous   continual   Wform
support
on
national
defence
is
deemed   -   Rloc-
important
to
ensure
peace
and
harmony
within
the
society
.

apart
from
the
above
points
,
it
is
mentioned
by
the
opponents
that
by
developing
power
reactors
,
many
job
opportunities
will
be
created
for
the
people
since
they
need
-   a   ArtOrDet
labour
force
to
run
the

.

furthermore
,
health
care
providers
might
also
reveal
the

in

weakened   might weaken   Vm

first

the

the

the
success
of
applying

brings
a
substantial
increase

the

however
,
several
factors

help
ease

thirdly
,
some

concerned

become
a

enlarge
the
gap

from
this

we
can
draw
the
conclusion
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
customer

greatly
shaped

this
trend
towards   -   Rloc-

and
is
presenting
both   countries with   Others

i
agree

the

it
is
true
that   monetary   Mec
every
time
we
can
fix

thus
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
should
decide
on
what
is
essential
and
should
therefore
be
supported
by
the
public
sector

and
what

it

therefore

this

in   Amidst   Wci
this   the   ArtOrDet
rapid

the

thus

it

seems

eventually
benefit

although

that

have
the

by

as
an

people

lives

we   it is   Wtone

will
be
embraced
by
the

's
positive
perceptions
.

one
of
the
major
concerns
of
singapore
is
its
increasing
aging
population
.   -   Mec

firstly
,
with
-   a   ArtOrDet
limited
budget
,
unlimited   -   Um

therefore
,
a
stable
economy
is
essential
for
us
to
progress
in
technology
and
having
a
more
reliable
source
of
energy
is
the
key
to
it
.

two
sides
support
their
on   -   Mec
views
on
pro
and
cons
to
nuclear
energy
.

hence
market
users
will
not
be
tempted
to
buy
the
product
,
which
would
cause
the   -   ArtOrDet
sales
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
market
to
be
low
.

besides
,
engineers
need
to
consider
about   -   Prep
the
electric
car
's
safety
,
cost
and
effects
to   on   Prep
the
environment
so
that
this
engineering
design
meet   meets   SVA
the
need
.

with
proper
policies
for   -   Rloc-
implementation   -   Rloc-
,
``
-   pub   Mec
public
budgetary
resources
would
be
used
only
to
secure
minimum
standards
and
basic
social
services   rvices ''   Rloc-
.
''

hence
,
using
-   a   ArtOrDet
rfid
equipped
card
to
track
and
control
entrance
is
not
secure
and
effective
at
all
.

pertaining
to
these
concerns
,
the
'defense-in-depth
'
approach
adopted
by
vhtr
consists
of
prevention
and
control   plants   Nn
of
abnormal
operation
and
failures
,
detection
of
failures
,
protection
against
accident
progression
and
mitigation
of
the
effects
of
severe
accidents
and
substantial
amount
of
released
radioactive
materials
.

-   The   ArtOrDet
government
should
stress
the
important
role
of
filial
obligation
because
it
not
only
reduces
the
burden
of
elder
dependency
but
also
give   gives   Vt
the
elderly
indirectly
benefit
through
investing
in
their
children
.

-   The   ArtOrDet
council
for
third
age
(
c3a
)
was
formed
under
mca
,
to
further
promote
active
ageing
through
community-based
projects
(
mcys
,
2006
)
.

moreover
,
a
dwindling
population
signifies
-   that there are   Ssub
lesser
people
to
defend
the
country
.

in
conclusion
,
individuals
should
be
obligated
to   push   Wform
reveal
such
information
to
their
relatives
because
it
is
a
personal
responsibility
,
and
can
lead
to
improvement
of
their
well-being
.

however
,
their
spirit
of
creating
a
better
world
for
future
generations
can
not
be
measured
by
money
and
unfortunately
if
they
suffer
financial
hardship
we
should
help
them
genuinely
as
they
are
our
pioneers
-   of   Wci
to
improve
country
development
.

first
of
all
,
the
post-war
economic
recovery
demanded
a
better
way
of
communication
in
order
to
expand
the
network
of
free
trade
between   among   Prep
different
countries
.

while
some
proponents
suggest
that
it   this   ArtOrDet
is   involves   Wci
the
privacy
of
the
individual
who
undergoes
the
genetic
testing
,
but   -   Rloc-
the
test
results
might
also
have
adverse
effects
to   on   Prep
those
who
are
closely
related
to
that
person
.

in
fact
,
the
strategy
used
by
singapore
's
government
was   has   Vt
proved
-   to be   V0
a
success
,   . For   Srun
for   . For   Srun
instance
,
statistic   The economy   Wci
shows   has shown   Vt
the   -   ArtOrDet
real   -   Rloc-
growth
that
averaged
-   at   Prep
8.0
%
from   between   Prep
1960
to   and   Wci
1999
to
9.9
%
in
2000
.

as
we
all
know
,
petrol
is
-   a   ArtOrDet
non
renewable
natural
resources   resource   Nn
and
hence
changes
of
its
price
has   have   SVA
a
big
influence
to   on   Prep
the
world
economic   economy   Wform
as
all
main
transportations
are
using
it
as
fuel
.

however
,
as
in
the
recession
period
,
old
people
got   have   Vform
difficulty
in
supporting
for   -   Prep
their
own
living
expense   expenses   Nn
,
which
results
in
social
spending
for
the
aged
.

nowadays
criminals
and
terrorists
are
equipped
with
high-tech
-   equipment   Others
,
therefore   so   Trans
we
have
to
take
some
appropriate
actions
-   to protect ourselves against them ;   Others
of
which
surveillance
is
one
even
we
have
some
sacrifice
.

although
this
scheme
does
not
provide
100
%
coverage
on
their
medical
bills
,
patients
will
have
a
lesser   smaller   Wci
burden
when
-   the   ArtOrDet
majority
of
the
medical
bills
are
heavily
subsided   subsidised   Wci
by
the   the government   Mec
government   the government   Mec
and
supported
by
medisave
.

public
transportation
is
one
area
that
could
be
improved
if
the   a   ArtOrDet
country
limits   limited   Vt
its
spending
on
the
elderly
and
raises   raised   Vt
its
spending
to   for   Prep
the
former
.

for
example
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
fuel
injection
is
exhausting
carbon
dioxide
(
co2
)
as
a
result
of
incomplete
burning
of
fuels
.

even
if
it
is
to
be
declared
,
there
will
not
be
a
change
in
premium
charges
as
compared
to
those
who
declared
who   that they have   Pform
has   that they have   Pform
a
family
history
but
has   have   Pform
not
gone
for
genetic
tests
.

critics
say
that   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
spending   -   Rloc-
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
and
used
for
other
areas
of
development
.

although
,
the
welfare
of
the
senior
citizen
may
be
important
but   -   Rloc-
it
should
not
be   to   Wci
in   to   Wci
an
extent
where
the
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
are
being
hindered
.

opponents
have
also
argued
that
renewable
energy
-   sources   Others
is
a
better
source
of
energy
as
it
produced
cleaner
energy
when
compared
to
nuclear
reactor
,
which
produces
radiation
and
nuclear
waste
.

as
a
result
,
the   show   SVA
bad
effects
seems
to
outweigh
all
:
the
source
of
workers
flows
to
foreign
countries
where
they
can
find
an
ideal
environment
for
studies
and
works
,
most
never
come
back
to
mother
country
;
it
is
too
easy
to
hold
2
or
3
degrees/diplomas/certificates
but
in
fact
the
holders
have
no
professional
knowledge
and
experiences
;
not
only
lack
of
professional
workers
but
the
their
quality
has
also
gone
down
.

limit   to limit   Wci
spending
on
the
aged
means
that
there
will
be
a
larger
amount
of
funds
available
to
spend
on
infrastructure
development
.

another
factor
is
that
swcr
only
can
react
under
the   -   ArtOrDet
very
high
pressure
.

firstly
,
scwr

improve

current

recycling
all
the
actinides
used
in

and
its
nuclear

.

are
as
capable
of
operating
and
monitoring
equipments   equipment   Nn
as
the
younger
,
stronger
workers
-   are..   V0
.

in
conclusion
,
limitation
to
public
spending
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
aged
and
diversion
of
money
to
other
areas
of
development
should
be
implemented
.

the
same
kind
of
situation
is   also occurs   Wci

by   in   Prep
singapore
,
china   China   Mec
,

,

and
other
asian
countries
.

thus
,
in
order
for
such
policies
to
ease
the
issue
of
a
greying
population
,
the
paradigm
of
aiding
the
country
must
be
observed
by
the   -   ArtOrDet
society
.

for
instance
,
in
singapore
,   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
number   -   Rloc-
of
people
over
the
age
of
65
will
hit
a
high
19
%
by
year
2030
.

therefore
several   -   Rloc-
research   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
development   -   Rloc-
and   -   Rloc-
policies
have
been
used   implemented   Wci
to
ease
the

to
support
the   -   Rloc-

there

then   In that situation   Trans
,
who

the

to
do
it
?

basically
,
this
process
can

if
the

way
that

because

only
reasonable
that

in

such

hence

initiated

there

in

it
may
be
said
without

fear

however

despite

role
played

there

the

thus

by

thus

the

for

thirdly

elizabeth

there
are
the
obvious
changes

the

change

there
is
close
to

these

our

thus
,
if

as

the

what

that

,

hence
,
with
the
creation
of
more
jobs
,
the

can
assist
the

to
secure
a

allow
them
to
support

,
with   on   Prep
the
condition
that
they
are
still
in   -   Prep

there
is

that

the
engineering
design
process
for
innovations
can
be
broken
down
into
3
stages
,   :   Mec
firstly   -   Rloc-
creativity
,
secondly   -   Rloc-
process
and
lastly   -   Rloc-
materialization

the
process
is
hard
,
but

are
still   -   Rloc-
willing
to
sacrifice
their
time
and
labor
for
the
development
,   . This is because   Srun

the

they

one

people
today
are
able
to
ease

aging
process
because
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
current
research
and
development
.

one
way
to
do
so
is   would have been   Vt
by
the
implementation
of
psychology
in
the
compilation
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
radio
convention
.

in
addition
,
human
scientist
will
focus
on
factors
that
are
closely
related
to
the

,
such
as
the

in

the

the

is
over

however
,
according
to
the
research
done
by
the
experts
,
the
very
high

be
designed
in   such   Wci
condition   such   Wci
that
the

will
be
competitive
when

with
other

and
the
capital

cost
will
be
low
enough
for
a

however
,
when
the
oil

drop
,
government   governments   Nn
and
company   companies   Nn
slowly
stop
to
pursue
the
alternative
as
they
can

.

neglecting
the
other
areas
of
our   the   Wtone
country

will
hinder

lead
to

thus
a

even
though
it

it
pays

as
it

the
most

is   was in   Wci
at   was in   Wci
1979

when

for

,
after

the

firstly
,
the

technology
is
still
immature

which
means
we

both
the

according
to

a

secondly
,
there
is
no
transparency
in

to
the
distribution
of

.

what
is
the   -   ArtOrDet
most
important
is
that

give

people   the aged   Others
opportunities
to
accumulate

,
making
them

some
may
claim
that

can
never
be
sure   -   Rloc-
if
there
will
ever
be
positive

it
is

that

last
but

,
some

may

the
rippling   in   Prep
effect
that
arises
from
the
small
social
issue
greatly
affects
a
country

developments
on
many
fronts

not

the

.

thus
,
many
are
put
off
by
the
idea
of
having
more   -   ArtOrDet
children
due
to
the
accompanying
life-
time
commitment
of
raising
a

.

then
the

have
to
stop

it
is
crucial
for
the

to
spend

on

as
not
doing
so
will
lead
to
social

it

the

their

the

various

formed
over

in
conclusion
,
although
it
is
indeed
necessary
for
the
government
to
take
care
of
the

people
in   -   Rloc-

there

some

in

,
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging

is
complicated
and
multifarious
,
-   and   Trans
it
affects
every

of
us
.

a

this

will
increase
the
period

however
,
in
my
view
,
limitation   placing a limit   Others
on
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
for
the
old   elderly   Wci
does
not
mean
that
we
do
not
care
about
the
ageing

.

furthermore
,
the
support
of
many
convenient

also
provides
the

a
better

to
face
with   -   Rloc-

as
mentioned

:
``
as

the

a

is
one
we
have
to
look
carefully
at
.

in
the
case
of
the

,
the

had
been
avoided
if
the

everyone
has
a
responsibility
to

and
people
need
to
change
their

that   of seeing   SVA
the

where   when   Wci
in

however
,
a

the
country

should
be
spent
on
improving
the
country
's

,
which
in

creates

the
implications
that
come

tend
to

by

.

last
for   -   Prep
but
not

,
gaseous
coolants
have
low

hence
requiring
an
intermediate
heat
exchange
with
a
larger

(

.

as

,
``

if
public

this
meant   would mean   Vm
that

to
provide
sufficient

such

it

but
also
possess

which
classify

sort

.

for

,
about
a

it

1943
,
abraham

published
a
theory
on
what   -   Rloc-
he   -   Rloc-
believes   -   Rloc-
is   -   Rloc-
the
hierarchy
of
needs
of
people
.

although
there
are
reasons
that
seem
to
support
the
funding
of
the
scwr
,
the
development
of
the
scwr
should
not
be
funded
as
there
are
other
factors
like
economic
and
social
feasibility
to
consider
before
we
can
conclude
that
the
funding
for
the
development
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
should
be
approved
.

firstly
,
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
ministry
of
finance
(   -   Cit
2009   -   Cit
)   -   Cit
in
singapore
,
funds
must
be
pumped
into
the
economy
to
ensure
solvency
of
the
country
.

thus
,
-   many   ArtOrDet
environmental
groups
have
been
pressuring
businesses
and
governments
for
'green
'
energy
solutions
as
we
thread   -   Um
our   -   Um
economic   -   Um
progress   -   Um
with   -   Um
sustainability   -   Um
.

still
,
in
order
to
counter
such
reaction   concerns   Wci
,
the
government
has
provided
various
incentives
like
the
baby
bonus
-   scheme   Others
introduced
in
singapore
which
is
to
promote
marriage
and
also
providing   to provide   Vt
incentives
to
boost
-   the   Vt
birthrate
.

our
problem
is
very
simple
--   -   Rloc-
--   -   Rloc-
we
need
more
efficient
resource   plural   Nn
to
generate
enough
power
for   -   Rloc-
us   -   Rloc-
and   -   Rloc-
last   -   Rloc-
for
-   a   ArtOrDet
long
time
.

another
problem
which
the
older
generation
may
face
is
social
discrimination
-   for   Prep
.

thus
,
the   -   Um
future   -   Um
for   -   Um
scwr   -   Um
is   -   Um
will   -   Um
be   -   Um
safe   -   Um
and   -   Um
effective   -   Um
.

singapore
's
only
resource
is
human   its people   Wci
,
thus
a
collective
effort
from
each
and
every
one   citizen   Wtone
of   citizen   Wtone
us   citizen   Wtone
will
make
a
vast
difference
.

in

no   -   Rloc-

with
increasing
terrorism   terrorist   Wform
activities
around
the
globe
,
the
ability
to
keep
the   a   ArtOrDet
country
safe
and
stable
-   has   Vt
become
an
important
issue
.

it
is
more
ethical
to
do
there   that   Wform
and
take
up
the
responsibilities
rather
than
finding
them
a
social
burden
and
just   -   Rloc-

make

that
``   there are   Others

for

or
even
neglect
them
just
because
of
pragmatic
reasons
.

in   -   Um
all   -   Um
,   -   Um
the   The   Mec
proportion
of
public
spending
on
the   -   ArtOrDet
various
sectors
should
be
divided
properly
in
order
to
promote
economic
growth
and
maintain
a
sustainable

-   for the country   Others
.

so
,
for
the
country
's
very
survival
,
it
can   eeconomic   Wform
not
afford
to
neglect
education
.

lastly
,
determining
which
safety
solution
is
feasible
comes
with
experiences   eexperience   Nn
instead
of
being
able
to
learn
it
of   from   Prep
a

.

firstly
,
opponents
of
using
nuclear
power
plants
argue
that
nuclear
power
-   to show   Others
is
not
a
safe
technology
.

secondly
,
singaporeans
'
refusal
to
take
risk   risks   Nn
and
their
contentment
with
their
current

are
also
causes
for
the
hampering

in
singapore
.

used
to
identify
a

based
on
his

.

opponents
say
that
comparing
with
the
other
five
generation
iv
reactors
,
the
cost
of

is
relatively
high
.

in

up
.

however
public
spending
budgets
should
be
drafted
with
more
considerations   consideration   Nn
to
avoid
any
misuse
of

the

will
then

such

nowadays
,
the

to
be
more

as

furthermore

therefore
,
support
should
be
given
to

.

for
another
example
,
during
this
recent
economic
downturn
,
most
of
the
major
manufacturing
companies
are
slowing
down
in
manufacturing
productions   existing products   Wform

releasing

another
difference
between

thus
,

might   increasing the responsibility of children   Others
lose

.

the
extravagant
public
spending
on
the

does
not
justify
its
cause
.   significantly   Wci

this
design
also
addresses
a   the   ArtOrDet
security
concern
of   surrounding   Wci
nuclear

as
we   -   Cit
know

today
,
the

they

however

concerned

last
but
not

,
sfr
has
an
obvious
advantage
over

however
,
as
healthcare
technologies
improve
,
the
costs
of   -   Mec
healthcare
also
increase
.

in
the   -   ArtOrDet
recent
years
,
the
changing
demographic   demographics   Nn
of

has
cause   caused   Vt
the
government
and

to
channel
more
resources
and

revise
public
policies
for
the

.

with
continual
advancement
in

medical

current
research

development
in

can
be
read
from
several
distances

one
may
argue
that
following
the
safeguards

it
should
be

to
hinder

the
needless

indeed
,
some

serve
its
sole
purpose
in
reducing
the
fiscal

not

easing

as
a
whole
.

they

moreover

thus   such as   Trans
in

one
aspect
is
that
of

the

to
the
extent

this

this

with

hence
,
i
agree

to
a
large
extent
,   that   Ssub
current
research
and
development/policies
have
helped
to
ease
the

the

been

likely
to   also   Wform
result

they

the

furthermore

is
common

that

these

during

comparison
and
contrast
of
two
technologies
innovated
in
these
-   ,   Mec
two
different
ways
gives
us
many
interesting
features
of
innovations
to
ponder
about
.

the
last
reason
that
advocates
for   -   Prep
funding
of   for   Prep
the
development
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
provide   -   Rloc-
is
-   that   Others
the
building

scwr
that   -   Rloc-
could
generate
excellent   desirable   Wci
jobs
for
the
society
(
nuclear
energy
institute
,
2009
)
.

hence
,
public
spending
from
the
government
is
needed
to
provide
the
elderly
with
a
comfortable
environment
to
enjoy
their
retired
lives
.

therefore
,
if
government
spending
on
the
aged
does   -   Rloc-
not   -   Rloc-
limit   -   Rloc-
but   -   Rloc-
increases
due
to
aging
population
issue   issues   Nn
,
the
budget
on
infrastructure
development
will
be
lesser
and
this
may
affect
the
country
's
economic
development
negatively   -   Rloc-
.

hence
,
with
more
funding
directed
towards
the
research
and
development
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
lfr
,
it
may
one
day
become
one
of
the
safest
forms
of
energy
generation   generator   Wform
.

for
example
,
a   -   ArtOrDet
man
has
mutation
in
his
gene
and
the
result
states
that
he
is
actually
a
woman
.

those   The   ArtOrDet
hollow
concrete
blocks
are
just   -   Rloc-
like
the   -   ArtOrDet
sponge
which
can
absorb
the
energy
of
the
sea
wave   waves   Nn
,
the
principle
is
that
when
the
seawater
flowed
into
the
block
,
the
water
would
rotate
automatically
and
finally
most
of
its
kinetic
energy
have   -   Vt
been   -   Vt
dissolved
.

and
it
is
in
no
doubt
that
the
aged
requires   require   SVA
additional
spending
on
public
pensions
and
health
care
.

as
the
source
of
money
for
the
government
is
mainly
the
tax
payers
,
this
figure
infers   translates as   Vform
a
burden
to   on   Prep
these
contributing
citizens
.

however
,
besides
focusing
on
the
improvement   improvements   Nn
of   offered by   Wci
a
new
design
,
one
should
also
pay
attention
to
the
possible
tradeoffs
.

the
discovery
of
penicillin
is
by
accident
and
after
a
long
time
-   ,   Srun
it
was
being   -   Rloc-
used
as
medicine
.

an
absolute
evident   evidence   Wform
that
proves
the
necessary   necessity   Wform
of
psychological
design
is
the   a   ArtOrDet
similar
accident
with
the
three
miles
island
nuclear
reactor
in
the
us
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
msr
is
able
to
not
only
operate
in
small
sizes
,
but
also   ensures   Spar
in
large
sizes
.

secondly
,
it
lowers   -   Rloc-
the
level
of
security
of
a
country
when
terrorists
are
able
to
hacked
into
their
system
and
take
control
of
the
country
's
well-being
.

we
can
us   use   Mec
percentage
system
for
the
policy
on
it
which
means
that
the
amount
of
spending
for
the
aged
will
raise   rise   Wform
altogether   together   Wform
with
the
improvement
of
economy   the economic   ArtOrDet
sector
.

first
of
all
,
water
channels
ran   feedback   Wform
through
the
core
of
the
reactor
vertically
instead
of
horizontally
.

the
completely
artificial
intelligent
robot
is
not
available
at
the
moment
.

therefore
,
the
vhtr
provides
a
number
of
processes
to
use
the
heat
and
produce
electricity
in   -   Prep
high-efficiency   efficiently   Wci
.

out
of
all
the
human
needs   -   ArtOrDet
in
the
world
,
to
have
clean
water
should
be
given
priority
compared
with
others
.

the
road
to
success
is
not
smooth
;
likewise
,   -   Mec
japan
's
engineers
had
gone
through
a
lot
of
challenges
and
tests
before
they
arrived
at
their
final
prototype
of
japan
's
first
eco-car
.

by
using

,
purchased
goods
and
whereabouts
can
be
tracked
easily
by
private
corporations
or
government
(

)
.

however
,
the
plant
is
not
an
ideal
plant
for
that
environment
.

in
a
worse
case
,
if
some
members
of
a
family
have
these
genetic
diseases
,
they
should
find
solutions
or
treatments
to
cure
them
or
at

prevent
the

all
this

therefore
,
they   have also been   Vt

a
report
released
by

even
mentioned
that
it
is
critical

the

(

finding
that

only
as

as

believed   believe   Vt
was   is   Vt
necessary

the

-   the   ArtOrDet
had
increased
the
housing
grants
from
$
30000
to
$
40000
(

.

some
of
the
vito
factors
leading
to
increased
safety
levels
requires   require   SVA
the
addition
of
new
features
into
the
vehicle
as
well
as
modifications
being   -   Rloc-
made
to
current

apart

the
technology
based
on

is
much
different
from

increasingly

it

this
is

shown
in

approximately
172

therefore
-   ,   Mec
we
can
see
how
abolishing   setting aside   Wci
old
engineering
processes
and
embracing
new
ones
can
satisfy
that
need
.

these
help
the

to

especially
criminal

however

there

perhaps

however

technology

can

however

the

there

some   -   Rloc-

,
this

increase

with
the

therefore
,
uranium   uranium   Mec

so
this
is
indeed
the

that
should
be

engineers

and
play

equipped

the

are
the
best

to

,
and
to

among
those
opposing
views
,
there
is
a
common
misconception
that
psychology
has
nothing
to
do
with
design
process   accompanied   Wci
.

in
a

,
public
spending
should
be
limited   -   Rloc-
and   -   Rloc-
wisely

in   to provide   Vt

-   The   ArtOrDet
madrid
international

on

suggested   highlighted   Wci
,   :   Mec
``
since

1950
,
the

has
increased
by
20
years
and
is
expected
to
extend

further
10
years
by
2050
''
.

therefore
,
psychological
factors
play
an
important
role
in
reducing
the
possibility
of
accident   accidents   Nn
as
well
as
improving
the   a   ArtOrDet
system
's
safety
.

for
instance
the
ferry
's
design
is
a
huge
hull
for
which
-   of   Others
its
purpose
is
to
load
and
unload
cars
at
a
very
fast
pace
.

indirectly
,
it
could
help
in
medical
research
development
and
make
treatment
for
currently
untreatable
disease   diseases   Nn
possible
.

therefore
,
it
is
necessary
to
identify
the
need
from
this
design
activity
and
make
a
problem
statement
for   to   Trans
the   to   Trans
ease
of   the   ArtOrDet
gathering
information   of information   Trans
,   of information   Trans
choosing

conducting

.

therefore
,
the
use
of
surveillance
technology
on   for   Prep
tracking
people
should
be
banned
.

i
have
noticed
that
people
are
actually
trying
to
be
more
efficient
(
from
going
to
the
field
and
using
rocks
as
-   a   ArtOrDet
weapon
until   to   Prep
using
buttons
on
the
computer
only
)
and
this
is
the
second
reason
why
people
keep
spending
money
to
improve
nuclear
-   weapons   Wci
.

as
it
is
suggested
by
psychology
,
providing
favorable
working
conditions
and
environment
for
engineers
can
be
an
important
element
in
preventing   systems   Nn
accidents
from
happening
.

of
the

caused
by
errors

it
is
also
our
duty
to
take
care
of
the

before
acknowledging
our

as
an
ethical
one
.

subsequently
,
they

to

a

opponents

it

that

but
in

the

all
the   is   Vform

hence
put

we

maybe
for

besides
that   -   ArtOrDet
,
some

many

the

moreover
,
a

will
face

the

.

the
reason
why
-   the   ArtOrDet
americans
classify

''
to
be
above
65
years

is
due
to
the
fact
that
they
strongly

that
they
still

thus
they
continue

furthermore

on
the
contrary
,
the
national
survey
of

conducted
in

showed
that
63
%
of
senior

had
their

66

received

the   The   Mec
provision

might
be
seen
as
a
waste
of

since
most

have
the
ability

.

a

property

for

will
require
about
$
800
million
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
national
budget
(
singapore
government
,
2009
)
.

the
first
reason
about   -   Prep
why
it
is
good
to
fund
and
support
the
development
of
nuclear
energy
for
future
energy

is
about   -   Prep
the
limitation

actually
more

growing   A growing   ArtOrDet
gray

means
more
things
to
be
sacrificed
;   sacrificed --   Mec
one
of
them
is
public
money
that
is
spent
to
fund
the
aged
,
or   -   Rloc-
usually
known
as
public

for
the

given
the
current
shaky
economy
,
another
big
upset
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
our
lives
.

after

finally
,
all
in
all
-   ,   Mec
a
country
should
deal
closely
with
the
issues
of
an

in
addition
,
by
exploring
further
in   -   Prep
the
psychological
aspect
and
applying
it
in
our
daily
routines
,
many
of
such
major
accidents
can
be
prevented
or
minimized
.

while
singapore
strives
to
develop
itself
to
become
a
``
world-class
''
-   its   Pref
and
self-sufficient
country
,
it
is
equally
important
for
a
society
to
be
socially
stable
and
secure
.

the
survey
of
senior
citizens
(
1995
)
showed
that
although
the
health
status

generally
good
,
more

30
per

for

developed

to
a
new
degree   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-

.

however
,
there
are

however
,
the
aim
of
government   -   ArtOrDet
is
to
enable
people
in
its
country
to
live
better
and
happier
.

scientists

had
intended
to
use
nuclear
energy
for

purposes
like
using
it
as

with

i
believe
the

can
shift

and
the

be
greatly

hence
,
we
can
say
that
the
surveillance

in
tracking
people

or
products
should
be
used
.

information

have
enabled

witnessing
a
considerable
number
of

abandoned

while
some
might

there

people
in

can
do

it
might

it
must
be
pointed

that
it
is
even
more
important
for
this
group

to
plan
ahead
for
the

as
they
will
very
likely
lack
sufficient
resources
to
deal
with

when

surfaces

therefore
,
-   Wanger ( n.d. )   Cit
the
use
of

psychology
would
have
helped
to
prevent

for

however

since

we

all

one

knowing
more
about
a
risk
of
having
a
disease
may
help
people
to
be
more
aware
of
its
phenomenon
,
as
well
as
more
concern   concerned   Wform
on   about   Prep
their
health
(
cancer.net
,
2009
)
.

this
is
because
in
the
long
run
,
if
most
money
is
spent
on
accommodating
the
older
population
,
there
will
be
little
economic
growth
,
and
society
will
face
with   -   Prep
fewer
choices
on
how
to
care
for
those
in
need
(
robert

summer
,

)
.

however
,
this
promise
is
notably
associated
to
the
technologies
,
the
costs
and
the
precise
features
,
which
were
not
yet   public 's   Nn
known   public 's   Nn
with
high
precision
then
.

therefore
,
humans
tend
to
live
longer
and
the
ageing
population
is
rising
in   at   Prep
an
increasing
rate
despite   regardless of   Trans
how
developed
a   their   Pref
nation
is
.

education
marks
the
beginning
of
the
human
capital
investment
which
will
benefit
the
country
's
economy
in
the   pursuing   Mec
long
run
.

in
addition
,
many
are
concerned
that
nuclear
reactors
are
prone
to
being
used
as
a   weapons   Nn
weapon   weapons   Nn
of
mass
destruction
by
terrorists
and
hostile
countries
.

in
conclusion
,
there
is
adequate
evidence
shows   showing   Vform
that
the
use
of
psychology
during
the
design
process
would
have
largely
reduced
the
chance
for   of   Prep
the
chernobyl
accident
,
considering
psychology
could
help
to
make
people
pay
more
attention
to
the
importance
of
safety
and
consider
the
safety
of
the
whole
nuclear
-   system   Others
in
the
design
process
.

however
-   ,   Mec
with
the
designing
of
generation
iv
reactors
such
as
vhtr
,
the
problems
of
radioactive
waste
disposal
and
the
high
cost
of
electricity
generated
by
nuclear
power
plant
will
be
solved
.

for

,
increasing

last
by

,
the

is
the

at

those

therefore

both

genetic

gives

people   people information   WOinc

but
this

raises

about   -   WOadv
the   -   WOadv
ethical

whether
an

taking

must
reveal
the
result
to
third
parties
such
as
family
,
employers
and
friends
because
the
result
can
be
stressful
.

therefore
,
without
the
help
and
support
from

organizations
such
as
mcys
,
majority
of
singaporeans
might
not   be enrolled into   Spar
be   be enrolled into   Spar
able   be enrolled into   Spar
to
handle
high
cost
incurred
for
taking
care
of
the

.

some
people
say
this
solution
might
cause
financial
difficulty
to
many
elderly
and
their
family
,
especially
some
delicate   critical   Wci
segments
of
the
elderly
population
,
such
as
those
who
have
particularly
low
income
like
older
single

,
or
those
who

attained
little

.

however
,
vhtr
is

finally
,
after
comparing
both

we
will
realize
that
both

have
their

and

but
in
my
perspective
,
production
in
the
skunkworks

is
better
mainly
because
of
the

in

finally

the

first
of

,
public

have
the
potential
of

it

this
is

though
i
feel
that

should
be
limited
,
it
should
be
done
flexibly
and
contextually
.

on
the
other
hand
,
since
the
chernobyl
accident
that   -   Rloc-
happened   -   Rloc-
23
years

,
there
has
not

stove   The stove   ArtOrDet
has
undergone
a
very
long

it

also
,
certain
genetic
test   tests   Nn
such
as
the

is   are   SVA
a
very
private
matter

as

the

at
very
high

and
have
highly
automatic

,
so
they
are
more

however
,
as
the
world
becomes
more
competitive
and
``
smaller
''   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
government
and
public
have
realized
the
importance
of
sane
policy
and
innovation
.

the
concerns
are
uncalled
for   develop   SVA
as
continual
research
and
development
will
bring
about
cheaper
and
safer
operation
of
nuclear

looking
through   back at   Wci
the
whole
process
,
two
serious
problems
came
about
and
stunned   hit   Wci
the
industry
so
hard
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
it
is
the   a   ArtOrDet
wiser
choice
to
lower
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
,   -   Mec
because
the
net
benefit
from
such
an
action
would
be
much
greater
than
if
we
were
to
leave
the
spending
untouched
.

speakers
are
connected
to
a
single
music
source
which
carries   vibration   Nn
the
music
from

furthermore
,
since
old
people
stay
at
home
for   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
most
of
the
time
,
adequate
sunlight
would
help
them
to
form
the
cycle
of
day
and
night
and
thus
prevent
them
from
-   having   V0
sleep
disorders
.

thus
,
people
often
claim
that
age
dependency
has
become
an
actual
crisis
of
the
society
,
and
government
has
taken
action
on   -   Rloc-
attempt   -   Rloc-
to
decrease
their
social
welfare
expenditures   expenditure   Nn
during

some
feel
that
in
these
tough
economical   economic   Wform
times
,
it
is
wiser
to
splurge   spend   Wci
the
money
on
restructuring
the
economy
or
providing
more
incentives
to
instill   encourage   Wci
entrepreneurship
,
rather
than
investing

.

thirdly
,
government
can
provide
some
work
especially
for
the
old
unemployed
people
.

they
are
more
like
electric
motorbike   motorbikes   Nn
which
is   are   SVA
much
more
powerful
and
,
of

heavier

therefore
it
is   was   Vt
more
common
to
see
people
in

in
those   -   ArtOrDet
rich

those   -   ArtOrDet
poor

the

in
the
past
50

that
they
are
portable

which
means
they
can
effectively
prevent
sudden
heart
attacks
,
and
dependable
as
they
run
on

are
constantly
renewed

contrary

that

uranium

as
a

,

and
eventually
successfully

the
cause
is
due
to
concerns
over   continuous   Wform
the
cost
of
nuclear

most

,
the
safe

of

as

get
so   very   Wci
advanced
,
the
cost
of
medical

is
too
heavy
a
price
to
bear
.

then   At that time   Trans
many
predicted
that

videophone
would
be
very
popular
someday
and
it
would
be
loved
by

setting

especially

poor

and
the

from
the

it
has
shown
that
the

and
development

may
not
be
successful
in
helping
the
elderly
to
cope
with
the
aging
process
such
as
becoming
physically
disabled
or
-   feeling   V0

the

so
when

there
will
be
more

for

who
are
unfortunate
and
vulnerable

the
only
advantage
is
that
the

so

it

this

getting
common
and
it
is
actually
-   a   ArtOrDet
demonstration
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
lack
of
trust
between
the
management
and
the
employee
.

to
provide
different
ways
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

the
success
seems
to
be
too
far
for
the
public
to
feel
.

my
stand
is
as
long
-   as   Wci
disclosure
has
no
serious
social/ethical
consequences
,
the
subject
will
have
the
final
say
.

especially
during
the
cold
war
,
in
order
to
demonstrate
america
's
superiority
and
wealth
,
the
government
became   -   WOinc
more   -   WOinc
encourage   encouraged   Wform
the
car
industry
.

when
some
were
arguing
for
objective
difficulties
in
technology
,
it
was
admitted
by
the
main
contractor
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
major
cause
is
the
overload
-   of   Trans
temporary
works
and
their
low
quality
(

.

through
the
development
of
new
supplements
,
we
now
have
a
wide
array
of
vitamins
,
tonics
and
etc   so on   Wci
.   so on   Wci

however
,
many
might
argue
that
through
employment
,
older
workers
will
be
able
to
earn
their
upkeep
,
save
up
for
future
medical
needs
and
live
an
active
and
healthy
lifestyle

by

,
local   the   SVA
elderly
population
is
estimated
to
reach
a
million
(

.

by
investing
more
money
in
these
areas
,
a
country
may
generate
higher
return
and
has
-   a   ArtOrDet
higher
gdp
growth
.

these
new

would   will   Vt
operate
at

to
improve
their

and
they
would   will   Vt
include

that
rely
on
non
sophisticated
back

systems
to
eradicate
any
problems
.

for
one
thing
,
students
who
are
not
used
to
doing

,   -   Mec

usually
have
just
a
vague
image   idea   Wci
of
what
should
be
done

this

thus
,

these

be

resolve
the

the

if

that

it

the

from

although
there
is

a

has
been
planned
to
be

in

,
accounting
for
nearly
half

clearly
,
the

has
been   become   Wci
more
contented   -   Rloc-
and   -   Rloc-

through

to
a
large
extent
,
i
strongly
agree
that
medical

have   has   SVA
helped
to
ease
the

finally
,
opponents
also
claim
that
-   a   ArtOrDet
nuclear

should
not
been   be   Vt
built
due
to
its
high

.

in

to

before
the
product
is
implemented
,
it
is
important
that
the

is
being   -   Rloc-
tested
first
.

even
today
,
nuclear
crisis
in
north
korea
and
iran
still
threatens
the

therefore
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
if
terrorist   terrorists   Nn
are
determined
to
destroy
a
country
,
they
could
still
use
different
methods
even
if
nuclear
reactors
are
present
in
the
country
.

most
nuclear

involve
the
use
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
fast

technique
but
the
msr   MSRs   ArtOrDet
s   MSRs   ArtOrDet
use
a

known
as

been

to
be
less

from   In   Prep
my
opinion
,
i   there are   WOinc
can   there are   WOinc
identify   there are   WOinc
two
problems
that
lead   have led   Vform
to
this
situation
:
our
education
structure
as
well
as
the
shallow
engineering
heritage
that
we
have
.

(
burthler

additionally
,
according
to
the
economics
concept
,
there
is
less
third
party
cost
incurred
by
the   -   Wci
others
if
nuclear
power
is
used
instead
of
other
fuels
.

most
importantly
,
the
social
issues
aroused   arising from   Wci
by   arising from   Wci
consumption
of
lsd
are
unexpected
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
the
use
of
psychology
in
the
design
process
would
help
to
prevent
major
engineering
accidents
from
occurring   happening again   Others
.

on
the
other
side   hand ,   Wci
the
increase
in
public
spending
may
cause
self-dependency   dependency   Um
,
which
is   means   Wci
that
the

population   -   Rloc-
will
than   then   Mec
totally
rely
on
the

and
the
governments   government   Nn
for
their
needs
and
thus
would
be
exploiting
the
economy
rather
than
contributing

it
.

detractors
usually
dispute
that
old
generations
should
be
given   -   Rloc-
rights   -   Rloc-
to
claim
for
public
spending
provided
the
contribution
they
have
devoted
to
the
public
development

at
that
time
,
the

were
cramped

there
were   was   SVA
no

similarly

also   -   Rloc-
discovered

chemist
,
paul
muller
,
was
trying
to
find
a
way
to
protect

clothes
against

therefore
,
engineers
may
just
stop
at
gathering
pertinent
information
,
and
not
go
into
generating
multiple
solutions
as
they
are   -   Vform
worry
that
their

may
not
be

which
again

the

then
in

of

it
is
ahead
of
the   -   ArtOrDet

and
there
is
no

that
after

the

,
public
spending
on
the

could
and

be

however
,
as

quite

with

so
as
to

that

another
difference
is
the
final
usage   used   Vform
of
the

hence
,
funds

on
the
aged
should
be
limited
in
order
to

for
the
high

in

therefore
,

for
some
countries
with
little
economic

,
-   the   ArtOrDet

faces
few
choices
on
how

by

cleanliness
,

and
cost
,
this
can
also
be
reflected
in
the
very-high-temperature

(

.

the

thus
,
they
can
explain
the
implications
of
the
results
more
precisely
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
family
members
.

however
,
in
recent
years
,
our   the   Wtone
government
has
been
actively
promoting
creative
thinking
in   -   Wtone
us   -   Wtone
.

(
bbc   ,2006   Cit

.

this
is
because
what
the
aging
population
needs
are
their
children
-   's   Npos
providence
and
their
care
and
concern
.

this
technology
is
widely
used
in
our
society
and
it
brings
benefit   benefits   Nn
to
the
government
,
the
military
,
-   the   Spar
business
and
every
individual
.

to
conclude
,
the
nuclear-averse
public
oppose
the
development
of

because
they
do

another
great
benefit
under
the
extremely   among   Prep
high

reactors
can
be
used
to
split
hydrogen
from
water
thermochemically
.

lastly
,
the
consuming
groups
of
lsd
and
risperidone
consist
of   means   Wform
different
people
with
different
purpose
,
resulting
in
different
social
problems
.

this
raises
such   -   Rloc-
awareness
-   of the possibility   Others
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
waste
may
be
leaked
either
inadvertently
or
purposefully

any   and   Trans
of   and   Trans
which   and   Trans
would   may   Vm
cause
another
disastrous
catastrophe
.

since
the
demand
for
it
is
so
high
,
manufacturers
will
then
find
it
profitable
to
increase
the
supply
.

till   Until   Wtone
now
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
laptop
is
still
a
necessary
tool
in
people
's
daily
life
.

eventually
the
economy
will
be   benefit   Vt
benefited   benefit   Vt
when
people
become
healthier
and
spend
lesser
on
their
healthcare
.

a
team
with
single
major   specialities   Wci
can
not
satisfy
such
requirements
-   and   Trans
therefore
will
lose
the
ability
to
compete
with
others
.

we
will
also
expect
the
life
expectancy
-   of people   Others
to
increase
due
to
better
healthcare
facilities
and
technology
.

this
replacement   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
looking   -   Rloc-
after   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
elderly   -   Rloc-
will
only
encourage
more
infilial
children
to
neglect
their
elderly
parents
.

the
principles
are
establishing
a
perfect
patent   its   Pref
system
based
on
the
market

.

briefly
,
home
caring
is
going
to
be
the
long
term
plan
for
us
to
cope
with
the
problem
of
aging
population
in
the
future
.   -   Wform

in
all
,
carriers
have
the
obligation
to
inform
their
family
members
-   of   Prep
their
genetic
test
results
since
the
advantages
clearly
outweigh
the
disadvantages
.

again
,
this
shows
the
importance
of
considering
psychological
factors
in
design
process
.

how
do   did   Vt
i
design   develop   Wci
this
new
idea
?

to
conclude
,
the
train
accident
that
had   -   Vt
happened
in
germany
could
have
been
prevented
with
the
use
of
psychology
in
the
design
process
.

thus
,
they
are
'meltdown
proof
'
,
which
means
that
they
could   can   Vm
reduce
their
temperature
to
the
accepted
temperature
range
in
the

of

with

.

thirdly
,
limitation
on
public
spending
for
the
aged
is
not
as
bad
as
it
is   seems   Wci
heard   seems   Wci
.

as
a
result
,
this
design
improved   improves   Vt
the
safety
of
the
scwr

it
is
undeniable
that
by
increasing
the
retirement
age
,
the
elderly
will
be
able
to
accumulate
wealth
and
eventually
the
strain
on

will
be

the
role

suggests
that

play
specific
roles
in
their

their

.

as
long
-   the   ArtOrDet
as
the
nuclear

are
provided
such
as

energy
will
be
generated
.

furthermore
,
community
activities
are
well
planned
with   plan   Wform
many
interesting
ones
to
accommodate
their
interests
.

although
gfr
has
certain
deficiencies
at
this
stage
;   ,   Mec
further
r
&
d
funding
should
be
supported
because
it
has
three
main
advantages
in
terms
of
sustainability

safety
and
industrial
applications

opposition   Critics   Wci
feared   fear   Vt
that

although
there
are
many
differences
between
skunkworks
and
conventional
technology
,
both
of
them
drive
innovation
in
the
same
way
as
the
other   -   ArtOrDet
.

in
singapore
,
it
is
true
that
government
aid
is
important
to
the
current

as
the
majority
of
them
did
not
have

,
-   the   ArtOrDet

some
level

it
sounds
correct
in   to   Prep
some
extent
.

but
,
this
is
definitely
not
a
good
suggestion
because
i
believe
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
should
always
put
their

as
the

priority

making
decision   decisions   Nn
.

as
a
result
,
safety

from
happening
again
and   ,   Pref
which

so

among

,
economics   economic   Wform
and
social
policy   policies   Nn
aspects   -   Rloc-
are
widely
discussed
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
society

due
to
the

policy
of
bringing
in
foreign
talents
,
the
working   job vacancies   Wci
spaces   job vacancies   Wci

the

lastly
,
japan

followed
engineering
design
processes
,   -   Cit
khandani
(
2005
)
,   -   Cit
to
design
their
first
eco-car
.

another
reason
why
we
should
not
limit
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
older
population
is
because
of
the
fact
that
the
phenomenon
of
ageing
population
is
expected
to
continue
growing
.

moreover   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
this   -   Rloc-
group   -   Rloc-
of
elderly
had
work
hard
for
years
when
they
were
young
and
had
contributed
to
the
economy
and
society
.

the
third
step
is
to
transfer
the
electrical
messages
via
electromagnetic
wave   waves   Nn
to
the
destination
.

the
designing
process
requires
a
large
amount
of
raw
materials
for
repeated
fabrications
of
each
part
with
different
material   materials   Nn
in

to
obtain

generally
,
the
improvement

appearance
through
the
means
of
plastic

would
be
exclusive
to
only
those
who

the
fear
of
leakage
has
result
in
-   a   ArtOrDet
small
number
of
nuclear

being
built
on

however
-   ,   Mec
it
has
only
started
to
gain
momentum
recently
as
its
economic

this
is
shown
in

statistics

these   Such   Wci

.

nevertheless
,
it
still
affects
the
level
of
fund   funds   Nn
being
diverted
to
a
country
's
development
.

for
example
,
doctors
nowadays
can
be   -   Rloc-
able   -   Rloc-
to   -   Rloc-
build
a
complete
plan
to
slow
down
the
aging
process
;
such
-   a   ArtOrDet
plan
includes
-   an   ArtOrDet
individualized
nutritional
,
hormonal
,
dietary
and
exercise
program
.

this
may
due
to
the
various
housing
schemes
which
resulted
in
this   a   ArtOrDet
high
rate
of
having   -   Rloc-
elderly
to   staying   Vform

have   they end up with   Others
poor
health
condition   -   Rloc-
and
reduce   reduced   Wform
productivity
in
-   their   Npos
work
.

however
,
if
a
mixture
of
energy
production
options
is
continued
,
it
will   ,   Ssub
impact   ,   Ssub
the
environment
adversely
and
cause
climate
change
in
long
term
.

if
the
person
holds
thoughts
that
they
are
old
and
incapable   lives   Wform
of
achieving
great
things
,
then
she
will
succumb
to
the
negative
effects
of
aging
.

the
rapid
tempo
of
modern
life
also
results
in
wide
spread
nervous
disorder
.

besides   In addition   Trans
,
we
can
increase
the   -   ArtOrDet
crop
yield
by
cultivating
gm
plants
.

hence
,
some
forums
of   on   Wci
the   on   Wci
engineering
design
should
be
held
between
our
country
and
other
modern
countries
such   -   Rloc-
as   -   Rloc-
united   -   Rloc-
state   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
united   -   Rloc-
kingdom   -   Rloc-
and   -   Rloc-
germany   -   Rloc-
.

from
the
government
's
view
,
this
strategy
really   adults   Nn
saves
a
lot
of
money
for
them
.

therefore
it
-   is   Vt
worth
-   if   Trans
more
research
on
its
development
-   is done   SVA
.

as
-   the   ArtOrDet
economy
is
a
key
area
of
a
country
-   's   Npos
development
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
should
spend
more
money
on
economic
development
in
order
to
sustain
a
healthy
economic
growth
.

the
only
portion
which
engineers
would
need
to
figure
out
is
how
to
lower
the
operation
cost
of
such
-   an   ArtOrDet
imaging
device
.

according
to
khandani
(
2005
)
,
engineering
design
process   processes   Nn
play
an
important
role
.

i
could
not
agree
more
with
the
fact
that
the
carrier
's
privacy
is
sacrificed
when
he
or
she
reveal   revealsl   SVA
off   -   Rloc-
the

result
.

in
retrospect
,
countries
around
the
world
face
challenges
with
global   an increasingly aging population   Wci

.

the
public
does
not
need
to
worry
about
the
large
amount
of
radioactive
waste
produced
by
the   -   Nn
vhtr
because
the   -   Nn
vthr

is
contained
in
-   a   Nn
repository
that
is
very
resistant
to

of
radioactive

all

to

the
freedom

,   tests   Nn
and
most
importantly
the
freedom
to

choose

.

as
far
as
i
am
concerned
,
we
should   complaints from   Wci
not   complaints from   Wci
limit   complaints from   Wci
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
.

this
increases
much
pressure
to
the
government
when
dealing
with
every
aspect
like
economic
issues
,
or
infrastructure
systems   -   Prep
.

those
who
took
this
stand
overlook
the
very
fact
that
genetic
testing
results
only
shows   show   SVA
the
present   presence   Wform
of

does

policy
to
introduce
retirement
scheme   schemes   Wform
is
also
believed
to
be
one
of
the
factors
in
easing
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
process
.

many
countries
rely
on
fossil
fuels
as
their
source
of
energy
and
fossil
fuel
is
known
to
be
the
major
contributor
to   of   Prep

green   greenhouse   Mec

high
cost

be
incurred
for
certain
research
when
scarce

or
externally   -   Rloc-
imported
resources
-   are   V0
involved
.

firstly
,
the
ethical
aspect
of
privacy
and
confidentiality
,   -   Mec
need
to
be
preserved
.

in
one

,
energy

these
reinforced

extremely

so
even

the

(

.

most
importantly
,
limiting
public
money
spending
on
the
aged
will
save
a
great
amount
of
money
for
the
government   government   Mec
.

this
policy
provides
for
financial
security
for
the

they
are   would be   Vt
financially
dependent

and
need
not
rely

in
contrast
to
the
two

alternative

,
the
cost

is
higher

so   Hence   Trans
,
further

benefit

as
a
result
,
better

with

in

the

when

in

the

would
just

this

to

recently
-   ,   Mec
there
was
this   -   ArtOrDet
groundbreaking
news
stating
that
engineers
found
a
technology
called
h2car
process
,
a
process
for
producing
fuels
from
plants
or
what
they
call
the
process-biomass
.

for
example
,
some
relatives
would
have
the
thinking
that
the
genetic
risk
of
the
carrier
would
bring
about
-   a   ArtOrDet
bad
reputation
to
them
and   so   Trans
they
would   may   Vm
start
to

themselves

affects

firstly
,
it
is
important
to
reveal
the
result
if
a
couple
is
planning
to
get
married
and
one
of
them
has
any
inheritable
diseases
.

on

of
that
,
engineers
can
also
obtain
a   ; hence ,   Srun
variety
of
similar
products
and
analyze
them
together
.

past
events
such
as
the
incident
in

serve
as
a
grim
reminder
of
the
dangers
that
comes   come   SVA
with
a
nuclear

in
conclusion
,
it
could
be
a
wise
decision
for
the
public
to
evaluate
nuclear
energy
as
a
form
of
energy
and
eventually
,
support

for
it

by
improving
the   -   ArtOrDet

the

in

,
the
parents
can
supervise
them
as

in
this
case
,
it
would
be

to
increase

production
by
designing
a

firstly
,
the
advantage
of

is   -   Rloc-
to

this
is

there

do

in

,
engineers
need
to
be

in

to
come
up
with

at
the

time
,
cutting

in

however

when

as

the

is
the
ability

this
means
,   that   Wci
engineers
need
creativity
to
make
new
beneficial   useful   Wci
things
,
and
this
is
exactly
what
engineers
in

lack

along
with

sense
of

therefore

the

we

we

the

to
provide
the

the
flexibility
and
freedom
required
to
break
traditional

and
develop

on

of
that
,
the

implemented

in
conclusion
,
in

nevertheless
,
such
measure   measures   Nn
would
fend
off
new

(
who
are

)

and
may
even
propel
citizens

to

concurrently
,
the
sea
level
would
rise
and
cause
serious
floods   at   Prep
that
would
dangerously
threaten
the
survival
of
our
human
race
.

furthermore
,
another
main
concern
from
the
public
is
the   -   ArtOrDet
performance

radiation
during

secondly
,
the

inherited
genetic

may
affect
not

his

too
as
they
might
also
have
the
defective

.

besides
that
,
low
refueling
cycles
of
up
to
15
years
can
bring
down
the
total
cost
of

running
the

builders
of
the

plant
should
not
just
focus
on
the
one-time
cost
of
construction
;
rather
,
it   they   Pref
should
be
looking
at
the
long
term
running
cost
of
the

.

i
am
inclined
to   toward   Prep
the   recognising   V0

of

to

we
need
a
great
change
and
the
most
possible
plan
now
is
applying   to apply   Vt

however
,
one

can   some argue   Rloc-
not   some argue   Rloc-
either   some argue   Rloc-

his

prevent

therefore
,
it
is
unfair
to
refuse

some
of
the
housing
schemes
implemented
by

board
(

include
the

the

and
the

scheme
(

.

thus
,
it
is
crucial
for
countries
to
invest
in
the   a   ArtOrDet
form
of
education
that
is
desirable
for
its
people
to
ensure
greater

there

been

as
a
result
,
more
people
are
turning
to

as
a
solution
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
high
electricity
cost
.

according
to
butler
,
safety
is
a
main
priority
in
the
designs
of
new
nuclear
reactors
due
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
previous
nuclear
disasters
of
three
mile

and
chernobyl
.

in
early
1939
,
two
german
scientists

published
their
essay
about

and
also
stated
that
this
new
energy
recourse   source   Wci
can   could   Vt
make   bring   Wci
tremendous
profits
for
human

.

this
means
that
the
government
will
spend
less
money
on
fuel
in
the
vhtr
compared
to
the   -   Rloc-
other
generation
iv

.

with
financial
capacity   independence   Wci
,
the
seniors
would
not
become
the   a   ArtOrDet
burden
of   to   Prep
their
families
.

our   The   Wtone
world
always
improves
along
with
the

of

hence
,
the
demands

achieve   for   Wci
economic

pushed

forward
in

the
genetic

is
just
a
mean   means   Wform
to
know
whether
someone
has

but
it
does

they
will

after

,
the
hydrogen

replace

,
to
be
the
most
useful

important

in

.

lastly
,
the
policy
to
rise   raise   Wci
-   the   ArtOrDet
retirement
age
in
developed
nations
does
not
serve
as
a
long-term
solution
in
meeting
the
needs
of
the
elderly
.

however
-   ,   Mec
on
the
other
hand
,
critics
argue
that
the
economic
growth
alone
does
not
dictate
a
country
's
development
.

critics
might
think
that
as
someone
is
aging
,
the   that   Pref
person
is   -   Rloc-
can
no
longer
provide
for
the
society
anymore
.

for
instance
,
doubts
were
cast
in   on   Prep
the
ability
of
batteries
delivering
100km
per
charge
.

additionally   In addition   Trans
,
senior
workers
have
immense
experience
that
would
help
them
serve
as
advisors
to
the
companies
they
belong
to
.

this
shows
that
the
suggestion
is
not
going
to
work
as
it
will
cause
living   -   Rloc-
problem   problems   Nn
for
the
elderly
that   who   Ssub
depends   depend   SVA
on

spending   s.   Mec
and   -   Rloc-
at   At   Mec
the
same
time
does   it   Others
not
help
to
solve
aging
issues
.

thus
,
it
is
still
up
to
the
discretion
of
individual
to
go
for
genetic
testing
if
they
are
at
high
risk
.

even
if   that   Others
the   that   Others
individual   that   Others
chooses
to
tell
the
family
at
a
later
timing
for
the
benefit
of
not
wanting
to
worry
his
loved
ones
,
the
family
will
on
the
other
hand
feel
that
it
was
irresponsible
of
the
individual
not
to
share
his/her
burden
with
the
family
,
since
the
family
had
to
find
out
the
truth
from
another
party
.

there
is
actually
no
need
to
be
that   very   Wci
worried
.

as
people
get
wealthier
,
their
waistlines
get   aging   Wci
bigger
as
well
.

it
is
true
that
the
fruits
of
education
take
years
to
harvest
,   .   Srun
however   However ,   Mec
according
to
statistics
given
,
the
national
volunteerism
rate
in
singapore
has
risen
from
15.2
to
15.5
in
2006
,   .   Srun
this   This   Mec
does
shows   show   Vform
that
more
people
are
concerned
about
the
elderly
.

if
the

of   -   Prep

possible
risk
in
genetic
disease
,
they
can
perform   request for   Vform
-   the   ArtOrDet
genetic
test
for
themselves
.

therefore
,
anything
as
long
as
-   it is   SVA
people-oriented
will
get
the
biggest
benefits
.

in
conclusion
,
we
can
impose
law
and
limit
the
use
of
surveillance
technology
but
we
can
not
ban
it
.

many
governments
,
in

of
this
problem
,
would
invest
more   aged   Wform

however   However   Mec
the

of

as

therefore

meanwhile

some

the
chernobyl
disaster

occurred
on

caused

hence

even

china

economy
,
many
problems
also   have also arisen   Vt

.

taking   Let us take   Wci
an
example
of
the
stem
cell
research
centres
at
jurong
science
park
.

developments
in
information
technology
help
to
monitor
the
health
conditions
of
the
aged
without
having
-   them   Others
the
trouble
to
leave
their
homes
.

this
group
consists
of
students
from
the
school
of
design
and
environment
and
also
the
school
of
engineering
.

on
the
other
hand
,
in-vitro   in-vitro   Mec
fertilization

researched
upon   -   Rloc-
and
invented
with
the
primarily
objective
of
conceiving

of

.

they
should
consider
helping
improve
the
level
of
design
innovation
in
the
country
so
that
we
can   -   Um
compete
globally
.

firstly
,
rfid
has
been
seen
as
a
solution
to   for tracking   Wci
track   for tracking   Wci
medical
patients
.

the
increasing
size
of
the
economy
could
be
relatively
limited
,
but
it   spending more on the aged   Pref
does
allow
the
government
to
have
more
choices
to
take
care
of
the
aged
in
a
better
way
.

singapore
can
limit
public
spending
on
the

,
using   use   Spar
the
savings
and
indirectly
alleviate   -   Wci
or   -   Rloc-
even   -   Rloc-
reduce
the
total
expenditure
catered   -   Rloc-
on
the
aged
in
terms
of
healthcare
and
accommodation
.

in
this
way
,
the
whole
company
corrupts   is corrupted   Vform
and
becomes
obsolete
.

in
consideration   the case   Wci
of
singapore
,
shortage
of
water
results
from
several
reasons
such
as
-   its   Pref
geographic
position
,
-   its   Pref
climate
and
-   its   Pref
increasing
population
.

furthermore
,
the
current
working
age
group
may
not
have
anything
to
rely
on
when
they
grow
old
as
the
government
did
not
invest
enough
in
the
market
while   instead   Trans
placing
large
amount
of
the
funds
on

as

in

tetstiya

it
is
therefore

a
reasonable
expenditure
on
the
elderly

population
,
defined
as

``
a

in
the

''
(

)
began
to
take
place
in
every
country
and
region
across
the
world
during
the
last
century
.

it
is
acknowledged
that
the
usage
of
surveillance
technology
seems
to
invade
and
-   privacy   Others
violate
the
right
to
privacy
.

the
first
factor
that
shaped   for   Prep
the
mobile
phone
technology
is
the
market
forces
.

due
to
the
extremely
hard
reprocessing
of
its
fuel
,
it
deters
any
means
to
misusing   misuse   Vform
them
it   -   Rloc-
since
the
process
is
very
complicated
.

we
can
not
increase
the
amount
of
fossil
fuel
use   -   Rloc-
.

according
to
a
survey
conducted
in
australia
in
2009
on
the
public
opinions   opinion   Nn
of   on   Prep
building
nuclear
power
plants
in
australia
,
there
were
43
percent
of
the
public
opposing
the
plan
because
of
the
safety
and
security
issues
with
nuclear
power
plants
.

then   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
they   They   Mec
worked
hard
to
rebuild
and
develop
the
war-torn
country
into
what
we
are
living
in
now
.

the
reason
is
that
car
manufacturers
,
in
order
to
retain
their
market
share
of
gasoline
powered
cars
,
will
invest
time
and
money
to
promote

powered   gasoline-powered   Mec
vehicles
over
the
unproven
market
of
electric

.

hence
,
public
spending
on
this
sector
should
be
increased
such   so   Trans
that
a
balanced
and
more
structured
society
is
formed
and
a
more
rigid
social
safety
net
is
provided
.

hence
,
it
is
the
government
's
duty
to
come   -   Rloc-
in   -   Rloc-
and   -   Rloc-
render
the
help
to
them
instead
of
limiting
the
help
they
can
receive
.

the
strict
regulation
of
nuclear
reactors
by
the
government
and
together
with
the
current
technology
is
enough
to
ensure
the
-   that by   Spar
safe
disposal
of
nuclear
waste
.

many
of
the
young
adults
are   -   ArtOrDet
leaving
singapore
because
of
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
country
and
the
political
and

lock

enforced
by

reference
:

therefore
,
the
aging
population
is
not
an

problem
,
funds
could
be
sub-divided
for
the   -   ArtOrDet
expenditure
in
other
sectors
such
as

,
tourism
and
research
and

(

at
this
point
,
one
may
wonder
that   if   Ssub
the
elderly
pose   posed   Vt
a
financial
burden
on   to   Prep
the
development
of

singapore

in

they

technological

should
also
be
taking   taken   Wci
into

as
they
are
also
essential
in
easing
the
aging
process
.

in
conclusion
,
i
agreed   agree   Vt
that
public
spending
should
be
limited
as
citizens
should
not
be
over
reliant
on
their

and
the
focus
to

problems
should
be
to
increase

also
make

areas

similarly

,
which

indeed
,
the
fear
of
losing
security
is
a   -   Cit
distressing   -   Cit
concern
among
the
society
.

public
spending
may
not
be
appealing
because
there
are
no
advantages
and
immediate
benefits
received
from
spending
on
the

as
compared
to
using
these

as
a
result
,
singapore
has
strong
tripartite
ties
between
research

and   -   ArtOrDet
universities
facilitate
a
fluid
exchange
of

moreover
,
the

one

reduced

some
of
strategies

with

they
fall

when   After   Trans
the

produced
,
corporate

however

second
,
the
reason
someone

concerning   concerns   Vt
the

another

why

the

this
is
a
selfish

and
is
an

way

the

as
a
result

(

.

the
main
reason
lies
in
the

which

therefore
psychologists

during

due

is

either

in
conclusion
,
government

is
important
for
all
sectors
of
the

for
example
,
singapore
has
a

would
also
be

in

,
enhancing
the
psychological

of
the

can
make

less

and
cultivates
a

lifestyle
for

thus
making

if

it

they

it
is
well-known
that
there
are
various
areas

-   a   ArtOrDet

,   -   Rloc-
some
may
argue
that
since
the
elder   elderly   Wa
spent
their
money
on
their
children
,
it
's
now
the
responsibility
of
the
children
to
look
after
their
needs
,
and
not
the
government
's
.

for
a
country
which
has
an
area
of
960million
square
kilometer   kilometers   Nn
,
-   having   V0
enough
communication
satellites
are   is   SVA
the
first
security
for

information
communication
,
which
then
provides
a
good
environment
for
the
development
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
economy
.

one
of
the
solutions
is
to
do
a
``
replacement

''
where   e   ArtOrDet
-   recruited   Wci
the
foreign
talents
are
attracted
to
replace
the
lack

because

in
conclusion
,
in
my
opinion
nuclear
energy
can
be
used
to
solve
the
problem
of
increasing
energy
demand
in
various
industries
,
because
it
is
safe
to
both
human
being   beings   Nn
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
environment
,
and
it
is
capable
to
provide
relatively
larger
amounts
of
energy
than
other
sources
.

global
warming
causes
the   an   ArtOrDet
increase
of   in   Prep
the
average
temperature
of
earth
,
which
results
in
major
problems
such
as
melting
ice
caps
at
both
poles
,
rising
sea
levels
,
heat
waves
and
depleting
ozone
layer
.

the
first
similarity
is
that
at
the
first
step
,
they
both
require
scientists
to
make
every

to
get

this
is
because
the
designing
process
usually
involves
a
lot
of
trial
and
error
,
using
various
materials
for

in

to

in

however
,
as
we
all
know
,
the
elderly
only
constitutes   constitute   Vform
a
smaller
part
of
the
society
,
and
the
younger

in

must
be
taken

the

way
or
more
so
than
the

since
they
are
the

of

in

discovries   discoveries   Mec
ease
the

by
educating
the

-   on   Wci

peaceful

life
.

but
the
-   the   ArtOrDet
truth
is
technology
is
developing
every
day
.

therefore
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
retirement
age
should
be
extended
and
people
should
be
educated
to
work
longer
and
save
more
for
their
future
livelihood
.

numerous
innovations
have
been
revolving   developed   Wci
to
ease
the
problems
faced
by
everyone
.

according
to
wilpert
(   had been   Vt
2007
)
,
inherent
safety
which
links
the
design
process
to
safety
concerns
must
be
taken
into
account
.

furthermore
,
in
my
opinion
,
employers
have
the
right
to
know
such
-   a   Nn
result
to
ensure
that
their
prospective
or
current
employees
are
not
placed
in
environments
that
might
be
hazardous
to
them
and
also
can
react
immediately
if
something
happens
(

.

in
the   -   ArtOrDet
light
-   of   Prep
the
above
,
current
research
and
governmental
policies
have
,
to
a
large
extent
,
helped   help   Vt
ease
the

.

more
prominently
,
countries
are
using   -   Mec
nuclear   -   Mec
energy
to
make
powerful
weapons
for
military
purposes
.

after
which
,
the
poverty
state
will
also
improve
gradually
since
the
country   that   Ssub
's
economy
is
boost
up
through

by   -   Rloc-
moving   Taking   Wci
a
small
step
forward
,   -   Mec
will
reduce
the   -   ArtOrDet
famine
.

in
this
survey
,
the
elderly
can
state
down
whether
they
do   -   Vform
receive
any
forms
of
subsidy
from
their
families
,
where
do   they stay , who   Wci
they
stay
with
,
and
whether
they
are
interested
to   in applying   Wci
apply   in applying   Wci
for
financial

.

in
order
to
resolve
these
problems
,
a
new
generation
of
nuclear
energy
system
which
is
called
the
fourth
generation
reactors
is
under   undergoing   Vform
test   tests   Nn
.

indeed
,
early
knowledge
of
the
risk
to   of developing   Wci
genetic
diseases
might
help
family
members
to
take
preventive
measures
to
reduce
the
onset
of
such
diseases
.

this
is
because
the
government
may
need
to
build
and
set
up
temporary
accommodations   accommodation   Nn
for
the
homeless
,
where
the
manpower
,
materials
and

will
cost
more
than
the

associated
with

.

in
summary
,
social
policies
such
as
increasing
in   the   Wci
retirement
age
might
result
in
lesser
dependency
on
the
younger
generation
while
lowering
the
barrier
of
work   employable   Wci
age   employable   Wci
immigrants
will
decrease
the
median

and
lastly
,
the
introduction
of

retirement
scheme
can
allow
people
to
save
for
their
retirement
.

in
conclusion
,
in
order
to   difficulty   Wci
help
ease
the

process
,
the
singapore
government
has
been
improving
and
implementing
various
policies
and
research
developments
to
meet
the
physical
,
financial
and
emotional
needs
of
the
individual
.

in
conclusion
,
it
is
not
wise
to
limit
public
spending
on
the
age
given
the
fact
that
reliance
on
the   -   ArtOrDet
government
support
is
necessary
to
certain
group   groups   Nn
of
the

in

,
individuals
should
be

this

in

the

it

if

the

the

of

has

the   The   Mec

it   This   ArtOrDet
helps
to
improve
people   their   Pref
's   their   Pref
lives
.

both
-   the   ArtOrDet
lfr
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
vhtr
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
over
the
other
in
terms
of
performance
.

the
problems
that
affect
the   -   ArtOrDet
engineering
design

when
people
see
some
new
products
or
discoveries
,
especially
those
close
to
our
daily
lives
,
sometimes
they
can
not
help
but
ask
themselves
why
-   ,   Mec
when
they
have   -   Rloc-
experienced
some
similar
things
,
they
failed
to
turn
them
into
innovations
or
products
.

as
genetic
results
are
precious
resources
for
gene
technology
development
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
decision
only   can only   WOinc
can   can only   WOinc
be
made
by
the
person
-   .   Mec
puts
genetic
researchers
into
an
awkward
position
for
they
can
not
use
the
information
without
his
or
her
consent
.

those   Carriers of genetic risks   Others
who   Carriers of genetic risks   Others
have   Carriers of genetic risks   Others
this   Carriers of genetic risks   Others
disease   Carriers of genetic risks   Others
perceived   perceive   Vt
a

sense
of
responsibility
to

information   information about their genetic condition   Others
with
others
(
loescher
,
crist
,
siaki
,
2009
)
.

hence
,
surveillance
technology
should
be
banned
because
it
is
ethically
wrong
to
invade
other
people
's   hack   Vt
privacy
and
it
is
an
obligation
to
respect
other
people
's
privacy
.

although
one
can
already
see
from
the
examples
above
that
spending
for
the
old
age
should
be
limited
and
the
fund
should
be
reallocated
to
other
sectors
,
one
might
still
think
that
we
are
in
debt
to
the
old
age
population
because
of
their
previous
effort
and
work
in
the
past
and
that
we
have
to
show
our
gratitude
to
them
by
allocating
some
fund   -   Nn
for
them
,
spending
too
much
is
still
not
wise
idea
.

furthermore
-   ,   Mec
education
also
helps
the
aged
to
acquire
new
skills
which
enable
them
to
work
even
at
an   -   ArtOrDet
old
age
.

in
usa
,
just
only
50   elders   Nn
%
of
adult
say
that
they
are
caring
for
their
parents
(
home
caring
or
supporting
money
)
so
if
we
can
raise
this
number
up
by
increasing
the
grown
children
's
responsibility
,
we
can
save
our
budget
to
pay
attention
to
other
necessary
fields
.

there
is
an
increased
demand
for
health
care
services
by
the
aging
population
.

however
-   ,   Mec
the
same
technology
can
also
be
used
to
track
people
and
intrude   steal   Wci
private
information
.

as   Compared   Mec

with

the

which   ; it   Trans
has
an
estimated

such

enable
the

and

their

but   However ,   Trans
the
real
situation
is
not
as
worse   bad   Wform
as
they
thought   think   Vt
.

-   The   ArtOrDet
singapore
government
have   has   ArtOrDet
devised
plans
and
policies
to
develop

strong
sense

familial
commitment

to

the

a
noteworthy
example
is

.

with
this
policy
,
the
government
is
then
able
to
redirect
these   -   ArtOrDet
resources
to
more
vital
sectors
.

due
to
the
large
population
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
elderly
,
the
aging
issue
is
raising
more
and
more
concerns
in
the   -   Rloc-
current   -   Rloc-
society
.

in
the
case
of
the
tomato
harvesting
machine
,
there
are
plenty
of
factors
that
need
to
be
consider   considered   Vt
.

firstly
,
a
modern

will
bring
about
higher   s   Um
capabilities   s   Um
,
effectiveness
and
efficiency
.

high
temperature
processed

the
reactor
can
be
used
as
a
condition
to
yield
hydrogen
from
sulphur-iodine
cycle
,
which
is
a
series
of
thermo-chemical
processes
that
will
fail
without
-   a   ArtOrDet
sufficient
source
of
heat
.

on

the
prime   Prime   Mec

pm   -   Rloc-
lee

said
in
a
speech
:
``
singapore
has
treated
social
welfare
as
a
dirty
word
.

moreover
,
retrenching   reconsidering   Wci
the
education

can
initially
give
the
poor
some
opportunity
to
have
education
in
rural

thus   . Thus ,   Srun
this
will

benefit
to   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-

one
significant
phenomenon
is
that
the
doctors

masters
and
graduate
students
in

call
their

'boss
'
,
which   -   Rloc-

they   They   Srun

thus
,
it

has

for
the

to
decide
how
much
budget
should

the
problem

employers

environmental
agents
that
might

them
to
have

this
means
that

a

coolant
will
be

cause

the

in

the

in
the   -   ArtOrDet
most
unfortunate   -   Rloc-
cases
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
information
would
not

firstly
,
an

should

basic

finally

firstly
,
in

,   some danger posed   Srun
the
scenario
of
an

since
the

the

in

it

the
problems
that
contribute
to

is   are   SVA
that
there
are
not
many

left
in

-   because of   Spar
the

however
,
as

was
developed
later

the

,
especially
later

the

there   They   ArtOrDet
are
the
ones
who
build
up

to
what

by

be

one
of
the   the elderly   Wci
reasons   the elderly   Wci
why

has
the
highest

is
because
governments

some
of

when
the

public

has
increased
as   to   Prep
a
considerable
proportion
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
governments
-   will   Vt
find
it
difficult
to
keep

in

both

developed
not

by

furthermore

to

can

in

to
that
,
the
aged
would
be
living
in
the   a   ArtOrDet
community
of
people
in
their
age
group
,
and
this
provides
a
good
platform
for
the

to
socialize
with
others   their peers   Wci
.

people
may
argue
that
action   actions   Nn
speaks
louder

since
all
the

do
is
to
talk
,
it
will   it definitely sounds   Vt

sound   it definitely sounds   Vt
easy
.

however
,
one
must
realized
that
the   -   ArtOrDet

can
help
the

to
be
better
prepared
or
even
prevent

with   -   Prep
the   -   ArtOrDet

the
problem
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
growing
aging
population
in
singapore
could
be
curbed
by
encouraging
later
retirement
,
longer
working
lives
,
and
lower
barriers
to
elder
employment
,
as
suggested
by
peterson
-   ( year )   Cit
.

both
technologies
benefit
the
lives
of
people
,
and
have
potential   potentials   Nn
for
profit
.

by
doing
so
,
the
children
will
have
an
aim
to
excel
well
in   -   Rloc-
their   -   Rloc-
education
and
so
will
not
be
involved
in
activities
that
will
degrade
their
morale
values
.

the
aging   -   Rloc-
population
in
singapore
is
aging
rapidly
.

besides   In addition ,   Trans
the   -   Um
term   -   Um
which
may
cause
-   an   ArtOrDet
accident
is
low
due
to
the
continuous
removal
of
mobile
fission
product   products   Nn
.

so   Thus   Trans
,
the
sum
of
all
the
-   various   Others
cost
of
the
nuclear
power
is
relatively
lower
than
the
other
sources
of

.

in
1960
,
the
annual
fatality
due
to
vehicle   vehicles   Nn
reached
50,000
that   and   Others
drew
the
government

attention

the
safety
issue   ie   Rloc-
on
the
transport
system
.

i   -   Wtone
think   -   Wtone
there   There   Mec
are
two
kinds
of
technology
that
contribute
a
lot
to
the
increase
of   in   Prep
the
life

of

.

to
prevent   have prevented   Vt
the
accident
,
it
is   would have been   Vm
important
to
consider
the
safety
-   of the system   Others
from
a
macro
view
by
analyzing
the
whole
nuclear

,
including
the
interaction

this

thus

the

may
not

in

the

indeed

money

but
it
is
the   -   ArtOrDet
society

responsibility
to

and

on

of

is
becoming
increasingly

.

in
conclusion
,
the
use

should
be
banned
as
it
can
be
a

threat
and
it
intrudes

since
the

imposing

once

it

and
other

rich
in

and

could
significantly
increase
their

of
a

.

this
can
be
attributed
to
the
inflexibility
of
the

causing
rejection
of
innovations
that

less

with   to   Prep

discussing   -   Um
this   -   Um
in   -   Um
a   -   Um
narrow   -   Um
context   -   Um
of   -   Um
financial   -   Um

would   -   Um
mean   -   Um
that   -   Um
the   The   Mec
government
first   -   Rloc-
has
to
groom
potential
leaders
and
scholars
to
understand
the
importance
of
financial
planning
before
they
can
lead
and
share
.

although
six
possible
concepts
were
developed
i
personally
believe
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
molten
salt
fast
reactor
concept
is
the
best
solution
amongst
the
six
.

until   -   Prep
today
,
the
process
of
solar
energy
research
is
still
quite
difficult
.

the   This   ArtOrDet
need   This   ArtOrDet
can
be
seen
when
they
are
willing
to
spend
hundreds
to
thousands
of
dollars
on
medical
bills
.

in
addition
,
we
need
to
pay
more   living   Wform
attention
to
the
way
we
place
our
priorities
.

in
-   the   ArtOrDet
face
of
a   the   ArtOrDet
possibility
of
getting
an
incurable
disease
that
will
affect
a
person
for
life
,
it
is
important
that
family
members
can
accompany
and
support
him
along
the
journey
to
fight
against
the
illness
.

in
singapore
,
prime
minister
lee
hsien
loong
implemented   -   Um
that
healthcare   the health care   ArtOrDet
system
will
be
restructured
for
the
ageing
population
.

however
,
more
effort
need   needs   Wform
to
be
put
into
strategic
planning
for
bridging
the
retirement
saving
gaps   gap   Wform
as
this
,
basically
,
is
a
method
of
short-term
saving   -   Um
on   -   Um
one   -   Um

perspective   -   Um
only   -   Um
.

somehow

what

of   are most concerned with   WOinc
the   are most concerned with   WOinc
most   are most concerned with   WOinc
when

therefore
,
we
can
not
stop
the
research
and
development
process
if
we
want
to
continue
to
have
a
better
energy
source

this
action
will
ultimately
affect
the
country
's
economy
.

the
outcome
would
be
homeless
elderly
turning
into
beggars
and
outbreak
of   -   Um
diseases   -   Um
as   -   Um
healthcare   -   Um
becomes   -   Um

for   -   Um

becomes
an

.

for
workers
,
they
will   would   Vm
only
care
about
how
to
please
their
leaders
to
get   receive   Wci
more
benefits
and
not
care
about
the   -   Nn
production
.

in
fact
,
the
reactions
of
people
with
disorders
are
different
(
cancer.net
,
2009
)
thus
we
may
not
be   have been   Vform
diagnosed
to
have
a   -   Nn
cancer
since
we
were
young
but
it
may
present   come out   Wci
when
we
are   reach   Wci
at   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
middle
age
.

secondly
the
control
rod
of
rbmk
reactor
is
1.3
meters
shorter
than   problem   Wci
necessary
,
which
led
to
an
abnormal
decrease
of

power
.

having   In having   Smod
this
festival
,
the
government
allows
the
elderly
to
enjoy
their
aging
life
together
with
their
family
members
.

actually
-   ,   Mec
the
air
traffic
controller
(

was
using
only
one
channel
to
communicate
with
two
approaching

at

current
housing
developments
and
policies
have
provided
better
choice
to
enhance
the
quality
of   enjoying   Vform
life
of
older
people
.

thus
,
i
agree
that
there
should
be
a   -   ArtOrDet
research
and
development
(
r
&
d
)
funding
for
the

iv
nuclear

we

on

some

then

there

.

therefore
,
the
emphasized
function
of

at

was
to

send

according   -   Um

,   -   Um

furthermore

thirdly

nuclear

if

can
not

so
that
the

might
be

,
the

hence
this

be

there

robert
b.
friedland
and
laura
summer
(
2005
)
mentioned
that
with
economic
growth
,
there   -   ArtOrDet
will
be
a
lower
demand
for
government
's
handouts
and
there
will
be
more
funds
made
available
for
elderly
welfare
programmes
.

in
cases
,   -   Rloc-
where
the
elderly
are
childless
or
physically
ill
due
to
aging
,
then   -   Rloc-
it
will
be
the
government
's
duty
to
take
care
of
them
.

many
countries
have
built
up   -   Rloc-
nuclear
plants
which
have
developed
to   into   Prep
generation
iv
.

however
,
government
's   -   Wform
policies
to
promote
nuclear
energy
are
still
met
with
resistance
from
the
public
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
humans
have
to
give
priorities
to
conserving
earth
's
natural
resources
and
protecting
its
environment
.

thus
,
the
efficiency
rate
is
still
very
comparable
to
other
reactors   funding   Nn
of
high
efficiency
rate
.

however
,
the
truth
is
that
surveillance
technology
does
not
prevent
terrorism
from
occurring
at
all   -   ArtOrDet
.

the
final
stage
in
design
process
is
to
implement
the
solution
.

(
rogers
,
e.
m.
(   points   Nn
2003
)
.

with
the   -   Rloc-
presence   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
the
new

imaging
technology
,
more
humans
were   would be   Vm
being   would be   Vm
able

make

technology
since
it   its cost would be   WOinc
will   its cost would be   WOinc
be   its cost would be   WOinc
cost-   its cost would be   WOinc
reduced
.

as
such
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
has
to
put
more
emphasis
and
effort
to   in imparting   Wci
impart   in imparting   Wci
financial
education
and
provide   providing   Spar
money
advice
and
information
to
help
the
elderly
-   to   Wci
better
finance
their
savings
and
incomes
.

moreover
,
it
is
better
to
try
preventing
things
to   from   Wci
happen   happening   Wci
rather
than
just
try
covering
it   them   Pref
up
all
the
time
.

this
way   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
it   -   Rloc-
helps
to
prevent
grown

children
from
running
away
from
their
responsibilities
towards
their
parents
.

one
important
technology
which
was
-   have   Vt
socially
determined
is
the
mobile
phone
.

nuclear
energy
will
be
the
one
as
nuclear
power
can
produce
50
%
more
electricity
compared
to
coal
and
it
emits
less
amount   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
dangerous
oxides
such
-   as   Others
carbon
dioxide
,
sulphur
dioxide
and
so
on
.

this
will
assure
-   the   ArtOrDet
public
that
it
is
worth
it
to
allow
the
technology
to
invade
in   -   Prep
their
privacy
.

in
conclusion
,
even
though
msr
cost   costs   SVA
more
-   due   Wci
to
research
than
vhtr
,
its
benefits
outshine
vhtr
.

the
consequence
is
that
a
large

the

this

in

secondly

however

without
sufficient

,   detrimental   Wci
the
military
loses
its
ability
to
procure
better
and
more
effective
weapons
and
devices
to
train
and
equip
soldiers
.

therefore
,
with
these
concerns
,
it
is
important
that
the
individual
requesting
genetic
testing
should
have
the
final
say
in
whether
-   or not   Wci
to
reveal
the
results
of
such
testing
.

if
we
observe
our

we
could   can   Vt
see
many
inventions
of   with   Prep
technological
creativity
such
as
computer
,

and
other
electrical

.

it
should
be
evident
that
arguments
against
the   providing   Wci
setting   providing   Wci
of   providing   Wci
r

d
funding
for

are
not
valid
.

nonetheless
,
with
proper   have been   Vt
genetic
counseling
which
is
usually
accompanied
by
genetic

itself
,
parents
may
decide
the
best
way
to

with
this
information
.

in
this
aspect
,
some

that

in   help address   Wci
the

everyone
has
the
right
to
the
protection
of

against

interference
or

.

thus
,
the
public
opposition
should
look
at
the
new
generation
iv

in
a
different
light
and
not
just
-   be   V0
based
on
some
of
the
incidents
that
had   -   Vt
happened
in
the
past
.

so
-   ,   Mec
there
should
be
limited
public
spending
on
the
aged
group
so
that
money
can
be
diverted
to
other

which
will
give

current

on

hand
,
the
modern

nuclear

still
can
not
be

applied
since
no

has
been
found
for

for

the

this
causes

to
have

and
thus
reduces

when

also
,
the

concerning

furthermore
,
new
challenges
and
problems
will
arise
in

;
hence
because
of
these
two   involvement   Nn
reasons
,
i
feel
that

should
not
be
too
focused
on
the
ageing
population
issue
as
there
might
be
other
more
urgent
issues
that
require

an

actually
,
decentralization

delayed

support
hamper
the
stage
of

to
a   quite a   WOadv
quite   quite a   WOadv
large

however
,
instead
of
limiting
fiscal
spending
on
the

,
there
are
alternatives
that
can
similarly   -   Rloc-
improve
the
productivity
of
a
country
.

the
second
limit   limitation   Wform
is
the
shortcoming
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
hawk-eye
itself
.

at
the
same
time
,
it
could
be
the
mindset
of
some
senior
citizens
,
who
feel
the
government
should
be
footing
their
bills
,
as
a
right
being   for   Wci
the
country
's
eldest   elderly   Wform
.

hence
education
is
comparatively   on   Prep
important

thus
requires
a
fair
amount
of
public
spending
.

also
,

have
mushroomed
across

in

past
year
as
part
of
a   the government 's   ArtOrDet
government
-   's   Npos
effort
to

a

of

by

could

as

while

especially
amidst

time
of

first   The first consideration   Others
is
that
the

can   should   Vm
be
channeled
to
more
pressing
issues   needs   Wci
like
eliminating
poverty
and
food
shortage
.

secondly
,
the
aged
generation
could
strain
national
budgets
.

hong

is
the   one   ArtOrDet
example
.

with
their
vast
knowledge
and
rich
experience
from
the   their   ArtOrDet
many
years
of
contributing
to
the
society
,
the
aged
would
definitely
be
an
important
resource
the
country
could
tap
on
.

usually
skunkworks
can
not
get
enough
support
to

rfid

such   According to   Wci
case   According to   Wci
can   According to   Wci
be   According to   Wci
seen   According to   Wci
in   According to   Wci

however

it

.

both   The   Rloc-
the   The   Rloc-

created
by

secondly

increases
,
health

one
of
the
concerns

that

instead
,
the

should
strike
a
balance
in

amongst
the
various
sectors

much   The   ArtOrDet
younger

will
not

with

moreover

there   -   Rloc-

a

the

the

therefore
,
it

now
there   analyze   Wform

so
we
can

finally

likewise

if

in

,
replacing

current

the
main
substance
that
causes
global

at
this
high

the
rate
of

will
dramatically
increase
and
much
more

will
be

the

if

china

another

in

allows

promptly
with
just

the

forecasts
that

thus
it
will
be
more
essential
for
the

to
emphasize
the
responsibility
that

bear

with

the

for

together

this

contains

steps
:
define

generate

analyze

hence

all

currently

as
we
all
know
,
our

needs   need   Rloc-
constant

to

some
of
the
ways
to
do
so
is
to

humankind

the   Limiting   Wform

whatever

is
in

that

hence

it

could
be
a   -   ArtOrDet
rather
large   substantial   Wci
with

however
,
till

there

this

the

for

nonetheless

do
play
an

in

,
it
would
only
be
right
for

out

overall
-   ,   Srun
it
depends
on

that   to determine   Ssub
whether

consequently
,
the

such

include
the

lastly
,
the
government
can
use
funds
to
improve

such
as
to   -   Rloc-

so
,
if

do   does   SVA
not

so
if

in

a

it

another
example
is

this

either

send

to

that

the

needs

for

,
one
may
think
of
solving
the

only

ultimately

the

hence
,
it

again
the

to

the

that
everybody

thus
there

what
is   shows   SVA

the

to

it
is
vital
for
the

to
limit
the   -   ArtOrDet

a
reasonable

the

however

this

suitable

so

also
another
factor

however

therefore

the

it

by   There are   WOinc
three
methods
that
tackles   can tackle   Vform
the
problem
in
a   the   ArtOrDet
long
run
.

firstly
,
despite
the
fact
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
cpf
is
a
flexible
scheme
to
enforce
savings
for
individuals
,
it
has
shows   shown   Vt
signs
of
weakness
and
was   has been seen as being   Vt
seen   has been seen as being   Vt
as   has been seen as being   Vt
insufficient
to
last
for
one
's
retirement
years
(
tsao

)
.

opponents
also
state
that
-   while   Srun
nuclear
power
is
indeed
dangerous
for
that
reason
,
it
is
impossible
not
to
have
accident   accidents   Nn
while
working
with
it
.

hence
,
i
hope
that
the
relationship
between
the
generations
can
be
nurtured
and
the   -   ArtOrDet
children
will
take
the
responsibility
to   for   Wci
take   taking   Vform
care
of
their
parents
.

however
,
the
children
have
to
realise
that
by   -   Prep
not
assuming
their
responsibilities
to
care
for
their
parents
,
it   affects   Vm
would   affects   Vm
affect   affects   Vm
the
whole
society
.

what
the
customers
are   were   Vt
willing
to
buy
gave
rise
to
the
preference
of
companies
.

if
this
point   challenge   Wci
can
be
solved
,
the
potential
of
solar
power
is
prodigious
.

in
countries
like
china
and
india
,
their   the   ArtOrDet
population
amount   numbers   Wci
to   in   Prep
-   the   ArtOrDet
billions
whereas
the
population
of
singapore
is
only
4.5
million
.

many
states
such
as
the
us
,
the
uk
,
japan
and
singapore
start
to
implement
various
policies
such
as
increasing
child
birth
rate
,   and   Spar
saving   introducing   Spar
plans
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
and
health
care
policies
to
ease
the
ageing
process
.

however   -   Rloc-
this
concern
is
actually
redundant   unfounded   Wci
since
most
of   -   Prep
countries
have
reached
a   the   ArtOrDet
consensus
that
the
development
of
generation
iv
systems
is   would be   Vm
an
international
initiative
rather
than
an
independent
investigation
.

in
addition
,
the
responsibility
of
supporting
the
elderly
does
not
only
lay   lie   Vform
on
the
shoulders
of
the
government
,
the
elder   elderly   Wci
themselves
should
plan
for
their
retirement   retirements   Nn
when
they
are
still
economic   economically   Wform
active

at
this
point
,
one
may
take
advantage
of
this
scheme
to
claim
the
tax
reliefs
for
own   one 's   Npos
use
as
it
is
nearly
impossible
for
the
government
to
keep
track
of
where
the
money
is
spend   being spent   Vt
on
.

there
will
be
a
point
in
time
where   when   Wci
there
will
be
an
error
which
could
result
in
an
accident
in
the   a   ArtOrDet
nuclear   nuclear   Mec
power
plants   plant   Nn

this

furthermore
,
it   there   Pref
can   could   Vt
also
be
some
encouraging
activities
which
help
to
build
the
engineers
'
loyalty
towards
their
companies
and
help
them
to
realize
their
importance
in
the
companies
.

the
first
human
error
committed
was
to
continue
with
the
test
.

large   A large   ArtOrDet
amount
of
money
is
diverted
to
the
r
&
d
(

)
sector
to
give
singapore
a
competitive
edge
over
its
competitors
.

despite
all
these
improvement   improvements   Nn
,
it
does
not
mean
that
every
single
one
of
the
elderly
in
the
country
would
be
covered
and
well
taken
care
of
.

consequently   Not   Rloc-

being
able

could
allow

to
enter

and
possibly
carry
out
a
terrorist
attack
;
-   and   Trans
it
also
makes
it
easier
for
them
to
escape
.

as
suggested
,
``   will be   Vt
if
the

does
nothing
it
will
experience
a
rise
in

.

the

during

'take

'
resulted
in
a
serious
misunderstanding
between
the

and
the

of

.

so
it
is
easier
to
guarantee   -   Rloc-
the
safety
of

plants
because
if
workers
follow
the
regulations
,
no

will
be

to
ease
the

process
,
many
countries
'

steadily
as
a

.

trading
the

for
the
past
simply   is simply   WOadv

not
a

choice
.

this
will
reduce
the
burden
on
the
government
as
the

is
no
longer
required
to
look
after
the
basic

of
the

in

to

solving

a

should
act

is

some

for

on

burdensome
because
of
its
frequency
,
especially
for
those
who   stage   Wform
do
not
live
in

with
equipped
hospitals
.

in
japan
,
nearly
one
quarter
of
the
population
is
made
up
of
the
old   -   Rloc-
aged   elderly   Wci
.

therefore
,
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
limitations
of
technology
can
guide
engineers
to
invent
a
product
that
fulfills
all
-   the   ArtOrDet
criteria
of   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
need   -   Rloc-
.

till   It was only   Wci
decades
after   later   Wci
,   that   Wci
people
found
-   out   Wci
that
-   the fact that   Others
fossil
energy
is
nonrenewable
and
fast
depleting
is
only
a
less   minor   Wci
serious   minor   Wci
problem
,
-   and   Trans
the
more
serious
is
that
the
world
's
average
degree
is
increasing
since
the
final
product
of
burning
fossil
fuel
is
carbon
dioxide
which
is
the
main
source
of
aggravating
the
greenhouse
effect
.

this
point
of
view
seems
a
logical
argument
for
the
government
to
plunge
in
more
money
for
the
aged
.

in
addition
,
the
required
test
power
level
had
not
been
achieved
,
and
the
reactor
was
operated   operating   Vform
only
at
half
power
then
.

the
maintenance
fee   cost   Wci
that
is
required
for
each
nuclear
reactor
is
much
higher
than
for
a
conventional
energy
plant
as
the
safety
measures
for
these
plants
are
much
more
detailed
since
it
is
handling
highly
reactive
substances
.

despite
the
systems
and
policies
being
imperfect
,
it
has
definitely
brought
about
benefits
to
both
the
aged   -   Rloc-
and
general
public
as
a
whole
.

thus
,
the
welfare
programs
will
be
the   -   ArtOrDet
vital
for
them

though

,
many
fail
to

causing

the

advanced
by

that

be
used

the

it
is
known
that

large
percentage

and
also   -   Rloc-
due   -   Rloc-
to   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
combustion
of

however
,
the
concept
of
a
vhtr
,
one
of
the
safest
reactors
proposed
,
encompassed
this
consideration
and
will
prove
hard
to
be
a

the

in

on

hand
,
life
today
is
different
from

in

because

instead

they

where

facing   In the light of   Wci

such

this

on

it
is
not

right
to
leave
the

this
problem
is
very
serious
in
many
third
world
countries
in
africa
as
well
as
asia
.   `` ( 2005 , p11 )   Cit

many
countries
have
made
individual
retirement
fund   funds   Nn
mandatory
and
hence
successfully
increase   increased   Vform
the
number
of
nations   individuals   Wci
who
are
able
to
support
themselves
in
their
old
age
.

there
are
several
reasons
to
this
situation
.

more
often
than
not
,
the
construction
and
maintenance
of   regard   Nn
common
walkways
fall
under
the
prerogative
of
the
local
government
.

as   -   Rloc-
it   It   Mec
not   -   Rloc-
only   -   Rloc-
protects
our
country
from
external
threats
,   and   Trans
it   and   Trans
also   and   Trans
brings
foreign
investment
into
our
country
.

often
,
some
engineering
processes
lie
within
a
thin
line
away
of   from   Wci
some
juristic
rules
.

not
only
that
,
all
the
residential
committees
(
rc
)
and
community
centres
in
the   many   ArtOrDet
neighbourhoods
were
promoting
this
meaningful
and
encouraging   -   Um
health
program
to
the
needy
aging
population
in
singapore   Singapore   Mec
.

therefore
,
there
is
a
need
to
provide
constant
and
adequate
education
to
heighten
awareness   aged   Wform
in
the
people
regarding
this
issue
.

in
addition
,
the
government
is
trying
to
encourage
companies
to
hire
older
workers
by
providing   giving   Wci
incentives
to   -   Rloc-
it   -   Rloc-
.

the
united
states
predicted
that
the
demand
for
medical
care
will
significantly
outweigh
the
supply
of
healthcare
professionals
by
-   the   ArtOrDet
year
2020

)
.

even   In   Wci
so   In   Wci
the
result
is
still
unpredictable
.

so
,
the
company
refused
to
invest
in
the
research
and
development
of
the
laptop
computer   their   Pref
(
rogers
)
.

without
good
infrastructure
,
there
will
not
be
sufficient
facility   facilities   Nn
for
the
country
to   -   Um
develop   -   Um
.

in
conclusion
,
nations
should
be
careful
in
deciding
the
amount
of
spending   money to be spent   Wci
on
each
area
of
development
.

it
is
used
to
identify
the
cause
of
the
accident
so
that
corrective
measure   measures   Nn
can
be
taken
and   to   Wci
prevent
such
similar
case   cases   Nn
from
occurring
.

but
in
contrast
to
what
many
people
would
think
,
even
a
generation
iii
reactor   is   SVA
used
today
have
structures
that
can
sustain
a
plane
crashing
into
it
.

opponents
may
argue
that   -   Rloc-
health   -   Rloc-
data   -   Rloc-
of
patients
is
confidential
.

this
is
unfair
to
engineers
,
the
most
important
founders
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
modern
world
.

instead
,
this
should
always
be
a   concerned   Wform
combination
of
complex
methods
.

nuclear
power
makes
use
of
a
common
element
on
earth
,
which
is
uranium   uranium   Mec
.

thus
,
it
is
reasonable
to
assert
that
safety
in
the
design
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
vhtr
is
ensured
.

some
companies
in
china
usually
copy
basic
ideas
from
others
and
make
use
-   of them   Others
for
themselves
.

another
social
policy
that
governments
seem
to
turn
towards
to   -   Prep
is
the
encouragement
of
the
inflow
of
immigrants
into
our
society
.

at
the
same
time
,
the
government
and
the
companies
will
doubt
-   'whether '   Others
this
engineering
design
is
workable
or
not
if
it
takes
too
long
to
progress
.

in
order
to
have
more
money
for
other
areas
of
development
,
one
of
the
ways
is
to
reduce
other
sectors
of
public
spending
,
-   of   Wci
education
,
for
example
.

the
three
reasons
provided
explained   explain   Vt
why
public
funds
on

should
be
limited
and
divert   diverted   Vt
to
other
areas

however
,
many
people
look   think   Wci
it   think   Wci
in   think   Wci
another   think   Wci
way   think   Wci
that
it
is
a
waste
of
resource   resources   Nn
which

but
nonetheless
,
countries
that
are
already
dealing
with
the
problem
of
-   their   Pform
aging
population
had   have   Vt
identified
the
limitations
of
the
policies
that
are
implemented
.

thirdly
,
the
introduction   -   Rloc-
of
many
new
medicines
has
helped
to
ease
aging
problem
.

the
cpf
sets
aside
a
sum
from
their
monthly   include   Rloc-
salary
to
prepare
for
the
rainy
days
and
one
's

.

the
minimum
sum
was
set
at
$
80,000
in
2003   had   Vt
and
will
be
raised
gradually
until
it
reaches
$
120,000
in
2013
.

the
most
controversy   controversial   Wform
issue
in
the
used
of
rfid
to
track
people
is
the
invasion
of
privacy
.

public
spending
refers
to
money
expended
by
a
government
to
pay
for
areas
such
as
defense
,
development
projects
,
education
,
health
,
infrastructure
,
-   and   Trans
law
&
order
maintenance

and
such
spending
is
supported
by
taxation
.

if
the
results
of
genetic
testing
are
to
be
forcefully
revealed
,
less   fewer   Wci
people
will
be
willing
to
even
go
for
the
test
.

this
scheme
encourages
the
elderly

work   the concept of active lifestyle for the elderly   WOadv
even   the concept of active lifestyle for the elderly   WOadv
though
their

secondly
,
the
scwr
systems
are
able
output
great
performance
with
its
unique
characteristics
.

on
the
other
hand
,
critics
may
argue
that
genetic
professionals
can
interpret
the
genetic
testing
results
more
accurately
than
the   -   ArtOrDet
patients
.

for
the
vhtr
model
when
compared
to   its   Pform
the
msr
,
the
construction
of
the
plant
is
costly
and
takes
up
a
relatively
large
space
.

when
one
accepts
a
new
product
,
the
first
thing
-   that   Ssub
come
to
mind
is
``
how
to
use
it
?
``
.

discrimination
has
been
found
to
have
harmful
effects
on
people
such
as
-   putting them at   Others
a
high
risk
-   of   Wci
depression
.

secondly
,
nuclear
plants
are
said
to
be
environmentally
friendly
,   -   Mec
due
to
the
fact
that
they
do
not
produce
carbon

.

nowadays

various
kinds
of
retirement

are   is   SVA

states   the United States   ArtOrDet
,   the United States   ArtOrDet
japan

these
were   are   Vt
the
main
factors
why
few
nuclear
reactors
have
been
built
in
the
past
few
decades
in
many
countries
and
i
agree
that
-   the   ArtOrDet

should
not

the

moreover

required   requires   Vform

the

of

however

another
serious
problem
that
hampers

is
the

to

the

this

with   in   Prep

this

with

it
forces
a

to
be

throughout

other

however
,
if
public

not

,
more
financial

could
be
given
to

,
and
-   this   ArtOrDet
in

lessen
the

such
a

reduces
the

subsequently
minimizes

hence
,
i
believe
that
the

should
spend
more
money
to
subside   subsidize   Mec

an

the

meanwhile
,
safety
in

systems
is
always
a
critical
point
of
applied
psychology
and
industrial
efficiency
(
munsterberg
,
1913
)
.

from
another
point
of
view
,
there
is
only
a
minority
who
are
unhealthy   unable   Wci
to
work
;
the
majority
should
continue
to
work
as
long
as
they
are
able
-   to   Wci
thus
not
to
be
deemed
as
extra
burden
to
the
society
.

some
opponents
argued   argue   Vt
that
the
safety
of
the
nuclear
reactor
can
not
be
guaranteed
,
and
such
dangerous
power
plants
should
never
be
built
.

besides
relying
on
the
government
,
singaporeans
must
also
pay
attention
to

aging
issue
and
help
to
play
a
part
to   in reducing   Vform
reduce   in reducing   Vform
elderly
dependence
on
the
government
.

if
the
government
were
to
place
a
limit
of   on   Prep
its
spending
on   for   Prep
the
aged
,
the
aged
will
have
to
go
through
more
difficult
aging
process   processes   Nn
as
there
wo
n't
be
sufficient

for

the
similarities

are
that

the

however

as

over

therefore
,
careful

in

humans

and
has
also
sustained
the

objective
of

since
all
the

share
similar
genes
and
dna
,
the
discovery
-   the   ArtOrDet
of
any
members
with
a

means
that
the

fourthly
,
we
have
seen
the
application
of
surveillance
technology   by   Prep
in

to

this
is
due
to
the
confusing
systems
that

base
on
ambiguous

that
makes   make   Rloc-

the
major
reason
of   for   Prep
the
up   popularisation   Wci
rise   popularisation   Wci
of

is
due
to
the

.

therefore
,

.

the
high

another
factor
that
policy
makers
should
consider
before
deciding
to
set
boundaries
on
public
spending
on
the

is
issues
related
to
moral
standards
that
recent

have
witnessed   respect   Nn
their
decline

these
are
some
reasons
why
limiting

could
contribute

hence
,
in
my
opinion
,
using
-   a   ArtOrDet
large
amount
of
nuclear
power
as
an
energy
resource
can
bring
-   about   Prep
human
benefits
.

apart
from
the
influence
by   of   Prep
the
military
,
the
government
had
a
part
to
play
as
well
,
because
the
government
implemented
biased
policies
that
involved
building
more
gas
stations
and
roads
to
cater
to
the
gasoline-powered
vehicles
.

current
research
and
development
indeed
,   -   Mec
help   helps   SVA
a
lot
in
slowing
down
the
process
.

therefore
,
individuals
should
have
the
final
say
.

moreover
,
in
many
countries
,
the
governments
usually
do
not
pay
enough
attention
to
engineers
except
when
one
must
come
out
to
take   bear/ face   Wci
the
consequences
.

in
other
words
,
if
welfare
programs
for
the
aged
are
reduced
due
to
limited
spending
,
many
problems
will   would   Vm
arise
.

so
-   the   ArtOrDet
individual
requesting
genetic
testing
should
not
have
the
final
say
in
whether
to
reveal
the
results
of
such
testing
since
it
would
cause
serious
psychological
effect
on
people
who
do
not
want
to
know
the
results
.

nowadays
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
development
of
technology
has
been
going   progressing   Wci
on   progressing   Wci
rapidly
.

the
cost
is
heavy   high   Wci
,
especially
nowadays
when
new
technologies
and
treatments
are
expensive
.

although
engineers
and
operators
tend
to
oppose
the
using   use   Vform
of
psychology
in
engineering
design
process
,
research
results
have
shown
the
importance
of
psychology
in
preventing
accidents
by
using
their
professional
knowledge
.

welfare
cost
for
the
aged
will
increase
indefinitely
as
the
aging
population
keep   increases   Vt
increasing   increases   Vt
,   . So ,   Srun
so   . So ,   Srun
without   if the government did not limit   Vt

public
spending
for
the
aged
,
it
may
eventually
take
-   a   ArtOrDet
much
larger
portion
of
the
national
budget
.

privacy
is
the   a fundamental   ArtOrDet
fundamental
human
right
and
we
have
the
right
to
lead
our
life   lives   Nn
without
public
surveillance
.

however
,
should
the
government
decides   decide   Vform
to
spend
all
of
the
100
dollars
into   on   Prep
healthcare
,
there
will
be
no
profits
and
the
government
will
also
suffer
-   from   Prep
a
deficit
.

by
installing
handbars
and
improving
the
accessibility
of
lifts
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
are
now
able
to
move
around
safely
and
in
better   greater   Wci
comfort
.

however
,
some
people
disagree
with
the
government
-   's   Npos
policy
and
claim
that
there
is
a
need
to
limit
the   -   ArtOrDet
public

thereupon   Therefore   Trans
,
only
a
carefully

can
finally   -   Rloc-
meet
the
needs
of
reducing

being

in
other
words
,
majority
of
old
populations
can

live
independently
.

second
,
the
military
force
of

needs
the
support
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
space

.

this
prevents
``

and
to

(

.

they

so

the

the

for

has
these
four
processes   enhanced   Wtone
before   enhanced   Wtone
it
is
introduced
to
the
market
.

life-long
employability
would
be
one
possible
answer
to
this
problem
,
as
the
elderly
can
be
less
dependent
on
state
funding
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
contribute
back
to
the

of

in

,
life

is
not
similar
to

the
past
,

challenges
lies
ahead
waiting
for

to

so   -   Trans
how
do
we
go
about
in   -   Prep
changing
the
elderly
's
mindset
?

some
took
advantage
of
the
situation
and
make
use
of
the
low-cost

,
this   as can be seen in the long queues formed at the polyclinics in Singapore..   Srun

however
,
i
believe
that
instead
of
focusing
so
much
on
the
aging
issue
,
it
is
sometimes
wiser
for
the
government
to
divert
the
money
to
other
areas
of
country
's
development
-   ,   Srun
which
includes   include   Rloc-
education
and
military
.

(
ed
.
)
.

therefore
,
a
seek   search   Wform
for
higher
efficient
and
safe
energy
supply
is
desperately
needed
and
it
is
already
on
the
agenda
of
all
countries
.

secondly
,
by   -   Prep
extending
-   individuals '   Wci
working
lives   life   Nn
,   -   Rloc-
it   -   Rloc-
will
often
results   result   Vform
in
the
accumulation
of
more
wealth
which
can
be
used
to
support
themselves   them   Pform
in
the   their   Npos
old
age
.

for
that
,
the
competition
among
corporate   corporations   Wform
and
the
extent
of
price
slashing
they
are
willing
to
offer
-   ,   Mec
such
that
they
still
earn
an   -   Rloc-
amount   -   Rloc-
of   -   Trans
considerable
profit
may
help
improve
consumer
's
acceptance
of
their
product
.

besides
,
the
very
purpose
of
health
insurance
companies
is
to
provide
healthcare
and
to
ensure
the
well-being
of
the
people   -   Prep
.

on
the
other
hand
,
lead   lead-cooled   Mec
cooled   lead-cooled   Mec
fast
reactors
(
lfrs
)
has   have   SVA
various
safety
issues
which
are
of
concern
when
it
comes
to
building
a
safe
reactor
.

with
these
concerns
in
mind
,
scientists   an even   Wci
and   an even   Wci
engineers
have
developed
six
generation
iv
nuclear
reactor
concepts
with
enhanced
safety
features
that
would
prevent
another
chernobyl
.

for
instance
,
toshiba
's
corporate
leaders
denied
tetsuya
mizoguchi
's
request
on
the
laptop
project
(
rogers
,   is   Vt
2003
)
.

it   This   ArtOrDet
is
because
changing
the
ways
generating   to generate   Vform
energy
is
very
costly
and
the
safety
-   of such methods   Others
is
unpredictable
.

aging
issues
have
gained
substantial
attentions   attention   Nn
from
the
public
recently
.

however
,
i
believe
that
it
is
user   user-friendly   Mec
friendly   user-friendly   Mec
,
and
therefore
easy
to
pick
up
.

next
,
public
spending
should
be
channelled
to
the
education
sector
,
either
to
allow
more
people
to
get
the
chance
to
go
to   is   Vm
school   is   Vm
or
to
improve
the
standard
of
education
,
and
encourage
research
and
development
at
tertiary
levels
and
beyond
.

this
is
because
,
the
insurance
and
financial   in   Prep
services
association
(

)
in
australia
have
a
policy
that
states
,
genetic

,
will
not
be
required
for

in
the

there

the
similarities
between
these
two

are
-   that   Ssub
both

geothermal
energy
is
considered
as
the
most
potential
alternative
for

goods
has
been
highly
encouraged
by
the   -   ArtOrDet
environmentalists
.

another
point
to
be
raised
is
that
surveillance
technology
may
not
be
effective
in
preventing
nor   or   Trans
reducing
crime
rates
as
many
people
would   -   Vm
assume
that
they
do
.

after
the   all their   Wci
great   all their   Wci
effort
,
the
company
will
not
receive
the
benefit   profit   Wci
as   -   Rloc-
they
wish
,
which
will
definitely
cool
down
their
desire
to
innovate
.

these
might
well   -   Rloc-
be
the
two
factors
hindering
local
engineers
from
potentially   producing potentially   WOadv
producing   producing potentially   WOadv
creative
innovations
.

the
second
difference
between
these
two
cases
is
that
the
idea
of
innovate   innovating   Vform
-   the   ArtOrDet
laptop
was   -   Rloc-
come   came   Vt
out   from   Wci
with   from   Wci
the
inventor
himself
-   ,   Mec
while
the
electric
car
issue
is   was   Vt
a
requirement
by
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
.

so
,
there
should
be
improve   improvement   Vt
in
every
field
of
study
and
research
to
ease
the
aging
population
and
to
enhance
the
quality
of
life
for
a
global
population
that
will
double
in
size
by
2050
.

besides
that
,
nuclear
power
plants
are
safer
than
coal
mines
due
to
the
reason
that
designers
and
engineers
use
the
high-tech
in   occur   Vform

and
there
are
strict

with
most
of
the
elderly
retired
and
-   having   V0
no
source
of
income
,
they
might
be
unable
to
fund
their
medical
expenses
should
the
need
arise
.

with
regards
to
rfid
,
usage
mention   mentioned   Vform
earlier
on   -   Rloc-
will
reduce
the
variety

of
all
the
different
aspect   aspects   Nn
of
development
that
has   have   SVA
been
done
to
ease
the
aging
process
,
the
most
significant
field
is
medicine
.

a
possible
solution
for
this
is
to
scrap
-   the   ArtOrDet
national
default
retirement
age
which
often
give   gives   SVA
the
power
to
employers
to
retrench
those
above
this
retirement
age
.

in
addition
,
the
more

the

they
will
have

secure

sufficiently
at   during   Wci
the   during   Wci
old
age
without
being
dependent
on
their
children
or
the
governmental

.

in
terms
of
economics
,
old

financial
support
is
the
government
's
main
concern
and
therefore
mechanism   mechanisms   Nn
that

to
a

as
it
continues
to
accommodate

.

reclamation

was
also
limited
due
to
sensitivity

border
issues
,
thus
hindering
any
designs
that
require
huge
spaces
.

however
,
psychology
during
the
design
process
fails
to
consider
the
lack
of
appropriate
skills
and
training
of
the
labour
employed
during
the
time

in
addition
,
public
spending
on
the

not
be
limited
as

therefore
,
the   -   ArtOrDet

that

in

it

these

and
the
lack

that

last

certainly

,
technology

then   In   Trans

this

should
they

nevertheless
,
these
concerns
are
outweighed
by
its

due

the
benefits
it
brings
in

therefore
,
even
though   time   Nn
nuclear

is
certainly
dangerous
,
it
can
still
be
safe
to
work
with
as

the

so
that

in

the

some

argued
that

this

a

however
with
the
help
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
pension
system
,
it
has
provided
the

with
a
retired   retirement   Wform

thus
reducing
the

there

nevertheless
,
the

is
not

its

first
and

,
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
should
improve
the

therefore
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
cause
which
led
to
the

is
very
different

in
the

in

was
never

it
not

helps
slow
down

but
also
facilitates

the

believes
that
this
will

if
the
government
spend   spends   SVA
so
much
money
on
building
the
nuclear
plant
,
it
will
cut
costs
on
education
and
health
,
and
even
raise
taxes
.

in
conclusion
,
despite
singapore
's
efforts
in
establishing
herself
as
the
home
for
innovations
,
engineer   engineers   Nn
are
compelled   constrained   Wci
by
several
restrictions
such
as
lack
of
resources
and
the
inflexibility
of
the
social
system
.

for
example
,
if   -   WOinc
more
public
spending
on
education
will
be   raise   Vform
raising   raise   Vform
more
productive
children
so
that
-   a   ArtOrDet
more
affluent
future
generation
-   can be produced   Wci
and
the
size
of
tomorrow
's
economy
could   can   Vt
be
increased
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
limiting
public
spending
on
the
aged
will
reduce
the
dependency
of
the
aged
on
the
government
and
also   -   Spar
to   -   Spar
ensure
continuous
developments
in
other
areas
of
the
country
.

thirdly   A third   WOinc
,   A third   WOinc
another   A third   WOinc
reason
to
limit
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
will
be
that
the
aged
population
today
is
different
from
the   that of the past   Others
past
.

to
sum
up
,
oil
companies
,
car
manufacturers
and
the
government
-   have   Vt
considered
issues
from
the
economic
-   point of   Wci
view
and
realised
that
the
consequences
of
making
electric
car   cars   Nn
a   -   Rloc-
success   -   Rloc-
are
too
drastic
.

however
,
there
is
no
concrete
prove
about
the
above
argument
scientifically
till
now
.

implanting
rfid
chips
-   into humans   Others
may
also
result
in
cancer
.

the
core
is
composed
of
non-combustible
nuclear
grade
graphite
which
has
a
very
stable
structure
even
at
high
temperature   temperatures   Nn
and
high
heat
capacity
.

so
,
to
meet
the
human
need
,
scientists
are
looking
for
the
new   ruptured   Mec
method
.

``
fuel   argue   SVA
recycling
may
look
exciting
on
paper
;
in
practice
,
it
is
part
of
the
problem
,
not
the
solution
.
''

the
new
product
has
to   be   Others
de   devoid   Mec
void   devoid   Mec
of
sharp
parts
as
well
as
be
able
to
not
leave
any
sharp
edges
on
the
lid
.

and   Moreover ,   Trans
even
though
married
elderly
have
children
,
the
high
cost
of
living
is
also
putting
a
challenge
on
the
children
's
finances
,
which
makes
it
hard
for
them
to
provide
for
their
parents
.

the
advantages
of
genetic
testing
include
diagnosis
of
current
or
future
diseases
,
prevention
or
early
treatment
and
reduced   reducing   Vform
disease

in
future

.

these
fears
are   thousand   Nn
not
unreasonable
.

although
some
people
might
think
that
the
government
forces
them
to
contribute
part
of
their
income
as   to   Wci
cpf
is   -   Rloc-
against   -   Rloc-
their   -   Rloc-
will   -   Rloc-
,
they
fail
to
realize
that
this
'forcing   -   Rloc-
save   -   Rloc-
'   -   Rloc-
can
be
good
as
it
prevent   prevents   SVA
them
from
squandering
it
on
other
less
important
merchandise
.

questions
have
been
raised
by
opponents
of
nuclear
power
technology
regarding
the
security
of
the   so   Trans
fuel
pellets
,
which
are
rich
sources
of
uranium
.

only
-   by   Others
removing
the
obstacles
can
engineers
develop
science
and
technology
and
design
new
things
of
innovations
.

like
the
vhtr
system
,   -   Rloc-
gfr   -   Rloc-
uses
helium
as
coolant
which
has
a
high
outlet
temperature
of
850°c
,
making
it
able
to
split
hydrogen
from
water
.

compared
to
the
development
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
atomic
bomb
,
the
discovery
of
gunpowder
is   was   Vt
just
an
accident
or
something
unexpectable   unexpected   Wform
that
no
one
plans   planned   Vt
to
make
it   -   Rloc-

before   -   Rloc-
it   -   Rloc-
really   -   Rloc-
happen   -   Rloc-
.

only   must not only   WOinc

serve
its   their   Pref
functions
but
must
look

on

.

why   Flourides   Rloc-
fluorides   Flourides   Rloc-
are
favored
to
be
used
as
coolant
is   -   Rloc-
because
fluorine
does
not
need
expensive
isotope
separation
as
chlorine
does
(
per
f.
p.
&
haihua

,

)
.

using
these
data
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
can
look
for
a
doctor
for
early
diagnosis
.

hence   Nowadays , the elderly   Wci
,   Nowadays , the elderly   Wci
the
government
should
limit
the
amount
used
to
aid
the
elderly
as
their
financial
needs
are
taken
care
of
by
their
own
family
members
.

the
government
is
reluctant
to
see
such
kind   kinds   Nn
of
bad
influence
to
the
economy

with
some
necessary

in
minimizing
the

especially
those
that
are

hopefully
,
these
problems
can
be
eliminated
in
future
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
situation
can
become
better
and
better
.

in
conclusion
,
there
must
be
some
limitation
on
the
public
spending
in
order
to
divert
the
money
to
other
areas
contributed   which will contribute   Others
in   to   Prep
-   the   ArtOrDet
country
's
development
.

however   It has been argued   Wtone
a   It has been argued   Wtone
significant
amount
of
funding
should
also
be
diverted
to
other
developments
to
stimulate
the
economy
and
help
the
country
and
its
people
to
survive
the
economic
downturn
.

from
and   an   Mec
eco-logical   ecological   Mec
stand   standpoint   Mec
point   standpoint   Mec
,
the
world
should
decrease
the
use
of
fossil
fuel
and
try
to
find
other
ways
of
creating   generating   Wci
energy
.

spending
on
education
will
give
better
return   returns   Wci
to
a
country
in
near
future
because
education
is
a
major
factor
for
the
country
's
economic
growth
-   ,   Srun
whereas
the   -   ArtOrDet
spending
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
aged
is
just
the
opposite
-   .   Srun
which   Spending   Srun
is   Spending   Srun
spending   Spending   Srun
on
the
aged
is
inversely
proportional
to
economic
growth
.

to
solve
this
problem
,
the
-   a   Nn
best
way
is
to
emphasis
environmental
friendliness
when
engineers
design
machines
or
develop
new
procedures
for
industry
use
.

if
they
build
a
power
plant
that
can
produce
17.8
billion
kilowatt-hour
of
electricity
,
they
need
81
ton
uranium
,
or
4.34   concerning   Wci
million   concerning   Wci
ton
oil
,
or
6.51
million
ton
coal
and
the
generation

roman
iv
reactors
can
even
perform
better
.

it
was
noted
that
the
explosion
was
due
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
coolant
used
,
which
is   was   Vt
water
,
turning
to
steam
and
thus
,   -   Rloc-
suddenly
increased
the
power
produced
and
-   set off a   Others
nuclear
reaction
(
world
nuclear
association
,
2009
)
.

in
conclusion
,
the
individual
requesting
genetic
testing
should
not
have
the
final
say
in
whether
-   or not   Wci
to
reveal
the
results
of
such
testing

for

,
they   the government   Wci
have   has   SVA
upgraded
the
facilities

such   -   Rloc-
as   -   Rloc-
the
implementation
of

the

and
this

about
the
'tardiness

about

the

in

,
amidst
increasing
debates
about

,
the
ten

nations
of

another
use
is
to

they   from   Spar
going

every
step
deserves
our
full
efforts
.

their
concern
arose   arises   Vt
because
of
a
few
incidents
that
have
happened
in
the
past
which
includes
a
partial
reactor
meltdown
in
1979
at
three
mile
island
,
pennsylvania
and
also
the
1986
accident
at
chernobyl
in
ukraine
,
which   where   Ssub
the
reactor

exploded
and
caused
the
death
of
31
people
and
spewed
radioactive

across

.

people
spend
their
whole

working

contributing

the   balanced   Wform

of

so
after

it

for

to

,
and
elderly

is
somehow
the
requital
for
what
they
have
done
for

an
important
reason
why
individual
should
have
the
final
say
in
whether
to

the
results
of

is
because

however
,
limiting

does
not

to

even
if
there
is
a
need
for
additional

for
economical   economic   Wform
and
social
development
,
instead
of
limiting
or

on

,
the
government
should
look
at
other
areas
to
cut

one
basic
theory
is
using
an
electronic
handshake
spectrum
to
prevent
the
wrong
procedures
from
happening
.

while
the
use
of
nuclear
energy
rises   raises   SVA
some
concern
in
terms
of
security
and
cost
,
the
continuous
research
of

can
solve   address   Wci
them   these concerns   Others
through
the
recycling
of
fuel
and
the
use
of
a
different
variant
of
fuel
.

it
is
argued
that
the
government
should
provide
more
public
assistants   assistance   Wform
to
the
elderly
and
not
to
limit
the
amount
of
spending

this
is

this
article
will
discuss
the

between
these
two
patterns   types   Wci
of

this
will
satisfy
the
needs   Japanese   Npos
of
the

for

a
recent
research
-   shows   SVA
that
lighter
meals
may
prolong
human
life
by
having
calories-restricted
diets
.

however
,
though
technology
has
aid   helped   Vform
the
ageing
process
through
improvements
in
mobility
,
socially
and
mentally
,
but   -   Rloc-
to
the

family
and

are
ultimately
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
to
them
.they
can
help
them
with
money
issues
;
meet
their
social
needs
and
provide
a
home
for
them
.

this
counter
argument
is
good
but
it
may
be
not
correct
because
the
government
pays
for
the
other
areas
;   -   Rloc-
they   which   Wci
are
also
the
public
facilities
,
so
that
the

those

the

developed
much
earlier
,
if
toshiba
took   had taken   Vt
the
risk
to
develop
the

furthermore
,
it   -   Um
will
heavily
burden
those
who
have
an
elderly
-   person   Others
at
home
and
such
stress
leads
many
of
them
to
abandon
their
elderly
.

if
public
spending
is
not
limited
,
the
aged
or
the
working
people
may
take
the
aids
provided
by
the
government
for
granted   .   Mec
thus   Thus   Mec
they
may
not
work
hard
during
their
contribution
to
the

.

for
comparison
,
safety
belts
which
-   why   Wci
have
widely
been
accepted
on
all

solar
cars
,
can
also
cause
injuries
such
as
sternal
fracture
,
bowel
trauma
or
spinal

.

this
apparently
would
affect
the
operation
of
innovation
as
financing
resources
is   citizens   Nn
the
biggest
concern
in
an

process
.

however
,
with

secondly

however

the

that
it

the

nevertheless
,
the

should
not
be

for
the
manifest

in
conclusion
,
the
problem
of
-   an   ArtOrDet
aging
population
is
rather
a
problem
of
rigid
and
outmoded
policies
and
institutions
than
only
a
problem
of
a
demographic
change
.

the
first
problem
is
the
lack
of

engineers
left

very

real-world
variation
in
accomplishing
a
huge
project
like
constructing
an
efficient   energy efficient   Wci
energy   energy efficient   Wci
transportation
system
can
not
be
fully
comprehensive
and   nor   Wci
creating   to create   Trans
a
full-scale

of
the
system
is
even
more
unrealistic
.

however
,
it
would
be
ridiculous
that   for   Wci
the   for   Wci
relatives
are   -   Rloc-
able   -   Rloc-
to
know
that
they
might
also
face
this
particular
genetic
disease
in

future
from
the
individual
's
results
since
everyone
have   has   SVA
a
unique
genome
unless
they
are
twins
.

the
final
argument
advanced
by
opponents
of
nuclear   -   ArtOrDet
reactors
is
that
jobs
created
by
nuclear
power
plants
require
highly
skilled
workers
that
developing
countries
,
like
china
and
india
,
are
lacking
.

a
model
evaluation
was
done
by

for

and
it
found
-   the   ArtOrDet
following
problems
to
which
scwr
was
susceptible
.

as
compared
to
a
welfare-state
that
provides
pensions
indiscriminately
to
all
,
such
-   as   ArtOrDet
comprehensive
approach
would
demand
lesser   less   Nn
public
expenditure
on
the
aged
and
thus
funds
allocated
should
be
limited
accordingly
.

contrary
to
limiting
public
spending
,
critics
of
human
rights
have
been
rampantly   -   Wtone
advocating
that
state
funding
should
not
be
minimized
at
the
expense
of
growing
the
economy
.

hence
,
the
result
of
serendipitous
-   discovery   Others
also
helps
explore
the   -   ArtOrDet
unknown
things
and
places
.

in
this
case
,
if

is

thus

,
development
and

in

medical

have
helped
to

however
,
given
memories
of
the
partial
reactor
meltdown
in
1979
at
three
mile
island
,
pennsylvania
and
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
1986
accident
at
chernobyl
in
ukraine
,
during
which
the

core
exploded
,
killing
some
31
people
instantly
and
spreading
radioactive
debris
across
europe
(
butler
,
2004
)
,
the
public
is
concerned
about
the
safety
of
the
vhtr
.

a
nuclear
reactor
is
very
similar
to
a
typical
coal
burning
power
plant
where
they   water is heated   Wci

small

like
taps
,
water
coolers
,
-   and   Trans
washing
machines
,
can
all
be
the
targets
of
engineers
.

it
is
especially
true
for
the
single
elderly
who
do
not
have
any   productivity   Wform
children
to
take
care
of
them
at

.

in
the
united

there
are
device   devices   Nn
that
can
also
help
to
connect
the
elderly
to
the
doctor
without
having
them
to
go
to
the
hospital
everyday
.

in
conclusion
,
the
government
should
set
boundaries
on
public
spending
on
the
aged   for   Prep
so
that
people
will
learn
how
to
plan
financially
for
their
own
old
age
at
the
early
stage
.

greed
and
corruption
sink
in
when
the
people
at
the
very
top
refuse
to
give
up
their
power
and
used   use   Vt
underhand   underhanded   Wform
means
to
keep
themselves
in
power
.

they
will
generate
and
brainstorm
innovative
ideas
.

however
,
contrary
to
the
beliefs
in
asian
society
,
it
is
view   viewed   Vform
as
``
not
cool
''
in
the   you   Pref
western
society
to
be
living
with
your
elderly
parents
when
they
grow
up
.

assistant   assistance   Wform
schemes
such
as
the
'gst
'
offsets
,
rebates
,
service
and
conservancy
charge
rebates
serve
to
act
as
a
stimulus
for
the
country
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
hope
that
the
people
will
spend
more
to
keep
the
economy
afloat
.

here
we
just   will   Vt
use
the
supercritical-water-cooled
reactors
to
illustrate
for   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
reason   -   Rloc-
that
in   among   Prep
all
the
generation
iv
reactors
it
is
the
only
one
which
only
use   uses   SVA
water
as
its
coolant
and
the
wastes
are
optionally
recyclable
.

nobody
can
create
a
perfect
solution
with
just
one   start   Vform
try
.

as
people
age
,
some
of
them
are
unsatisfied
with
their
appearance
.

early   Originally   Wci
-   The   ArtOrDet
united
states
government
policy
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
cold
war
situation
shaped
the
invention
of
gps
.

during
the
maintenance
phase
,
the
psychologist
could   would have advised   Vm

the
maintenance
crew
to
be
more
serious
in

not   They should not have been   Others
be   They should not have been   Others
complacent
just
because
they
have   had   Vt
many
years
of
experience
.

for
example
,
studies
have
shown
that
just
as
a
child
's
nutritional
requirements
differ
in
quantity
and
quality
from
an
adult
's
,
the
nutritional
needs
of
the
elderly
also
differ
from
those   the   ArtOrDet
younger
adults
.

they
may
have
medical
check-up
more
frequently
and
if
there
is
any
disorder
that
can
threaten
their
life
,
it
will
be
identified
soon
and
it
is
always
better
when
we
can
control
a
disease
when
it
has
n't   not   Wtone
become
worse
-   yet   Trans
.

defence
not
only
ensures
national
security
but
also
maintain
peace
and
stability
in
the
country
.

but
history
shows
-   that   Wci
us
sometimes
the
fates
of
the
two
kinds
of
technologies
birthed
in
different
ways
are
also
not
the
same
.

the
lower
barrier
to
elder
employment
which
is   has been   Vt
set
by
the
government
has
allowed
employers
to
take
-   in   Prep
older
workers
to
work
in
the
career   jobs   Wci
mentioned
above
.

for
example   believe   Vt
,
a
research
and
development
team
with
financial
support
from
the
company
research
on
the
company
's
product
and
try
to
improve
the
existing
products
and
create
new
products
for
the
company

this
technology
benefits
the
elderly
by
obtaining
minimal
help
from
the
care
-   the   ArtOrDet
givers
to
feed
them
and
allowing
them
to
gain
confidence
in
living
an
independent

.

another
application

is

another

is
that

hence

these

and   -   Rloc-
enable

elderly
to
have
a
better
understanding
of
their
body   bodies   Nn

therefore

there
is
no
denying
the
fact
that
each
country
has
its   a   ArtOrDet
own   a   ArtOrDet
limited
set   -   Rloc-
budget
,
so
it
can
not
afford
to
spend
too
much
on
the
elderly
because
it
also
has
to
spend
on
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

for
instance
,
in
united
kingdom
,
a
research
done
by

and
summarized
by

elderly
people
are   have been   Vt
diagnosed
with

and
the
numbers
are
expected
to
increase

the
future
.

increasing
the
number

immigrants
will
help
to
lower
the
median
age
of
the

and
at
the

time
,
result
in
a
rise
in
the
efficiency
level
because
of
a
more

workforce
.

thus
,
preventing

beyond

essential
to
help
reduce
the
amount
of
pollutants   pollution   Wform
in
our

atmosphere
.

however
,
it
was
this
very
concept
which
backfires   backfired   Vt
,
as
users
of
the
phone
felt
privacy
intrusion
to
their
way
of
life
.

with
an
aging
population
,
the
government
has
to
direct
more
resources
to
take
care
of
the
needs
of
the
elderly
in
areas
such
as
medical   by   Prep
care
.

though
the
cost
of
installation
of
plant
and
maintenance
might
be
less
,
however   -   Rloc-
the
plant
life
is
only
60
years
.

and

(

)
.

unlike
the   -   ArtOrDet
traditional
asian
families
which
play
a
key
role
in
taking
care
of
the
old
,
most
western
families
have
a
looser
connection
among
the   their   Pref
family
members
.

hence
,
it
is
reasonable
to
further
develop
scwr
system
,
since
its
overall
performance
excels
.

another
example
was
the
technical
failure
in
the
forsmark
nuclear
power   -   ArtOrDet
plant
in
sweden
,
2006
.

from   In   Prep
this
train
accident
,
factors   the problems   ArtOrDet
begin   began   Vt
from
the
preliminary
wheel
design
that
design
engineers
came
up
with
,
to
the
insufficient
maintenance
of
trains
and
the
operation
mode

uses   used   Vt
.

firstly
,
the
aged
has   have   SVA
contributed
their
youth
to
the
advancement
of
the
society
.

based   This is based   Sfrag
on
the
fact
it
reflects
the
insufficient
investment
by
proton
's
shareholder
in
malaysia
compared
to
total
equity
owned
by
big
corporation
.

to
sum
up
,
the
government   extent   Wform
has
to
assume
responsibilities
in
taking
care
of
the
elderly
and
to
ensure
that
the
country
is
adequately
prepared
to
accept
an
ageing
population
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
and
money
should
not
be
diverted
into
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

therefore
,
there
should
not
be
funding
for
the
development
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
as
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
utilizes
two
key
ingredients
for
human
survival
.

the
mobile
-   phone   Wci
underwent
further
developments
to
enhance
its
features
to
suit
its
consumers

not
only
parents
and

but
also
-   the   ArtOrDet
whole
society
pushes
students
concentrating   -   Rloc-
on   -   Rloc-

plagiarism
is
not

harmful
for   to   Trans
the
original
researchers
or
writers
,
but
-   is   Trans
also
an
impediment
for
university
students
to
gain
creativity
and
innovative
skills
.

the
great
advances
in
medical
technology
over
the
years

resulted
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
improvements

and
hence
the   reducing the   WOinc

with
this
,
mobile

someone   Some   Wci

,   if   Wci
is   it is   WOinc
it   it is   WOinc
really
helpful
to

clearly
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
process
can
be
eased
by
current
research
and
development
.

there
is
no
need
to
worry

global
aging
has
become
a
worldwide
issue
that
many
developing
countries   -   Rloc-
and
developed
countries
are
facing
,
or
probably
will
face
in
the
future
.

and
this
in
turn
,   characteristics   Wform
leads
to
higher
market
prices
for
electricity

.

apart
from
finance   the issue of funding   Wci
,
education   the educational background of the Chinese   Wci
is
another
factor
that
can
not
be
ignored
.

in
singapore
,   -   Rloc-
seventy-five   -   Rloc-
percent   -   Rloc-
of
unionized
companies
have
committed
to
rehiring
older
workers

and
forty
percent
of
these
unionized
companies
already
have
in
place
formal
re-hiring
procedures
in
addition
to
ad-hoc
arrangements
that
are
commonly
made
.

to   In   Prep
conclusion
,
both
penicillin

telephone

according
to
em
roger
(

early
1990s
,
the
battery
technology

only
support

penicillin
inhibits

formation

which
is
essential
for
the
survival
of
bacteria
,
and
thus
kills
them

.

they
insist
that
fuel
is
still
a
cheaper
source
of
energy
than
nuclear   -   Rloc-
power
reactors
.

to
begin
with
,
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
governments
have
to
care
for
elders
partly
because
they
were
n't
much   constrained   Mec
concerned
about
their
health
in
the
past
.

limiting
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on

reduces

due
to
falling

,
i
believe
it
is
possible
to

however
,
in   -   Rloc-
my   -   Rloc-
view   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
i
agree
with
the
first
opinion

in

,
it
will
be
a

to

the   -   ArtOrDet

fuel
from
other
older
nuclear
reactors
as
its
initial
fuel
(

thus
,
the   needs   Vt

has
large

which
means
it
is
not
easily
corroded
even
in
high
temperatures
.

funds
directed
to
other
areas
for   themselves   Pref
the   themselves   Pref
country
's
development
will
also
benefit
the
society
.

however
,
to
avoid
compromising
the
development
of
other
sectors
,
it
is
essential
for
policy
makers
to
limit
this   -   Rloc-
perpetually   -   Rloc-
increasing   -   Rloc-
spending
on
the
elderly
by
looking
into
viable
alternatives
.

as
what   -   Rloc-
louis
pasteur
has   -   Rloc-
said
,
in
the
arena
of
observation
,
opportunities
favor
only
the
prepared
minds

the   -   ArtOrDet
chinese
education
has
a
history
of
over
2000
years
.

although
the
cost
of
the
surgery
is
high
,
given
the
high
quality
provided
from
the
robots
such
as
shorter
hospital
stays
,
faster
recovery
and
safe
operation
,
surgical
robots
is   should   Vt
therefore
-   be   Vform
encouraged
worldwide
.

although
nuclear

give   produce   Wci
mass   a much more significant amount   Wci

its

makes
the
public
concern   concerned   Wform
about
nuclear

.

as
long
as
the
real

can
be
translated

therefore
,
the
individual
should
bear
in
mind
the
consequences

and
decide
whether
to
reveal
their   the   ArtOrDet
genetic   the   ArtOrDet
results
-   or not   Wci
.

so   Therefore   Trans
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
children
today
wo   will not   Wtone
n't   will not   Wtone
face
the   financial problems   Nn

upon
having

and   has   Vt
infrastructure

,
the
country
will
be
able
to
attract
more
multinational
corporations
(

to
invest
,
and
thus
increasing
job
opportunities
.

to
make
things   matters   Wtone
worse
,
treating   treatment   Wform

the

and
the   so   Spar
list   so   Spar
goes   so   Spar
on
.

in
the
past
,
such
cases
were
lesser   fewer   Wci
as
abandoning
of
parents
is   was   Vt
seen
as
a
social
stigma

an
unfilial
act

together
,
the
cpp
and

provide
a

upon
which
canadians
can
build
their
retirement

[   ( author , year )   Cit

.

alternatively
,
there
should
be
-   some   ArtOrDet
adjustments
on
fiscal
spending
on
the
aged
based
on
their
percentage
in
the
country
's
population
.

moreover
,   hard work   Wform
the
law
enforcement
is
still
weak
and
the
punishment
for
violating
the
law
is
not
severe
enough
.

opponents
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
surveillance
technology
may
argue
that
it
overwrites
individual
's
privacy
.

it
can
only
be
used
-   the   ArtOrDet
in
some
trivial
electric
devices
such
as
mp3
player
.

moreover
,
creativity
stems
from
overall   the   ArtOrDet
analysis
on   of   Wci
what
we
have
now
,
what
we
need
to
have
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
future
and
most
importantly
what
the
differences
between
them
are
.

in
-   the   ArtOrDet
1970s
,
singapore
already   was already paying   Vt
paid   was already paying   Vt
attention
to
the
technology
of
its
own
water
supply
system
;
however
,
the
cost
was
enormous
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
technology
is   was   Vt
immature

.

if
the   -   ArtOrDet
funding
for
the
aged
are   is   SVA
limited
,
this
will
result
in
children
bearing
the
responsibilities
to
look
after
their
own
parents
.

if
the
family
member
-   waiting   Others
is
old
and
no
longer
under
high
risk
or
a
child
who
is
too
young
to
be
at
risk
,
there
is
no
need
to
reveal
disturbing
results
that
may
cause
potential
psychological
harm
to
them
(
agatha

denise
and

)
(

.

some
may
argue
that
until
now
,
-   away   Wci
the
scientists
and
researchers
are
still
researching
new
materials
to
reduce

and

to

thus
,
-   the   ArtOrDet

fails
to
notice

of

aging

is
now
a   for   Prep
serious
issue
in
most
developed
countries
,
where
the
number
of
young
people
is
overwhelmed
by
the
number
of
elderly
ones
.

government   Governments   Nn
should
spend
more
money
on
creating
healthcare
awareness
.

alike   Like   Wci
with   -   Prep
many
countries   governments   Wci
around
the
world
,
the
singapore
government
has
implemented
the
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
whereby
a
fixed
percentage
of
its
citizens
'
salaries
is
set
aside
to
the
fund
.

in
short
,
this
accident
could
be   have been   Vt
prevented
with
the
aid
of
psychology
during
the
design
process
in
the
maintenance
phase
.

in
conclusion
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
as
over-
provision
would
cause
over-reliance
of
the
elderly
and
leads   lead   Wform
to
an
inefficient
and
low
productive
workforce
and
population
.

.

friendships
may
be
important

but
surely
kinship
is
equally
,
if
not
,
more
important
.

however
,
the
participation
of
the
elderly
in
social
development
is
an
integral
part
of
country
efforts
to
improve
the
scientific
,
literature
and
quality
levels
of
population
and
their
contribution
far
more
to
the
community
than
you
could
ever
imagine
.

the
most
pressing
issue
is
finding
a
replacement
for
fossil
resources
.

this
will
benefit
the
whole
population
including
the
aged
through   by   Prep
providing
a
more
diverse
and
well-developed
system
in
transport
,
like
the
construction
of
the
new
circle
lines
in
singapore
.

(
rogers
,
2003
)
in
conclusion
,
there
are
two
main
differences
between
normal
discovery
and
serendipitous
discovery   -   Srun
,   -   Srun
one   -   Srun
is
the
purpose
and
process
of
the
research
and
the
other
one
is
the
process
to
turn
the
discoveries
into
use
.

even
though
it
may
be
costly
as
extensive
research
has
to
be
carried
out
and
expensive
construction
is
required
,
the
-   fall   V0
benefits
and
advantages
will
definitely
outweigh
this
hefty
price
.

thus
,
it
is
necessary
to
limit
public
spending
on   justifies   Wci
the
aged
due
to
the
negative
consequences
that
would
arise
from
doing
the
otherwise
.

according
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
statistics   statistical   Wform
data
given   provided   Wci
by
idaho
national
laboratory
,
the
thermal
efficiency
of
swcr
is
43.8
%
,
which
is
lower
than
that
of
gfr
,
48
%
.

in
contrast
to
other
such   -   Rloc-
accidents
-   ,   Mec
difference
is
that
accidents
related
to
nuclear
accidents
are
given
more
media
coverage
sparking
public
disapproval
.

that
was
the
first
time
engineering
students
from
nus
took
part
in
it
.

an
example
could
be
seen
in
the
united
kingdom
-   ,   Mec
where
healthcare
is
fully
subsidized
by
the
government
.

in
conclusion
,
the
lack
of
research
funding
and
-   an   ArtOrDet
exam-oriented
education
system
is   are   Vform
the
two
most
significant
factors
which
have
hampered
engineering
design
process
in
china
.

an
individual
might
chose
not
to
reveal
the
outcome
of
the
test
as
it
might
create
anxiety
on   amongst   Wci
their
loved
ones
.

for
examples
,
shopping
malls
,
industrial
estates   do not belong to the   WOinc
,   do not belong to the   WOinc
invested   do not belong to the   WOinc
properties
,
private
properties
.

other
than   is   Wtone
financial
schemes
,
the
government
also
provide
subsidies
for
patients
who
require
intermediate
and
long
term
care
.

with
the
advancement
of
science
and
technology
nowadays   -   Rloc-
,
this
dream
can
be
bring   brought   Vt
much
closer
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
realities   reality   Wform
.

though
there
is
an
issue
regarding
the   -   Rloc-
invasion   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
one
's
privacy
,
this
could
be
resolved
by
placing
appropriate
safeguards
which
protect
the
public
's
privacy
when
implementing
the
use
of
surveillance
technology
(
gray
,
2009
,
p.3
)
.

it
is
due
to
the
persistent
effort
from   of   Prep
researchers
that
many
of
today
-   's   Mec
technology
had
been
discovered
.

in
conclusion
,
the
molten
salt
reactor   a material   ArtOrDet
has
a
lot
of
advantages
with
no
radioactive
waste
,
high
safety
factor
and
lower
cost
.

the
resulting
situation
is
an
increase   increased   Vt
amount
of
stress
falling
onto
the
shoulder   shoulders   Nn
of
the
remaining
working
adults
as
they
struggle   struggled   Vt
to
provide
for
their
older
counterpart
.

the
final
issue
is
the
cost
of
the
surgery
and
system
.

thus
,
even
though
the
adoptions   adoption   Rloc-
of
the
immigrant
policy
have   has   SVA
helped
to
ease
the
ageing
process
,
it
might
not
be
the
best
policy
to
conquer
this   the problem   Wci
matter   the problem   Wci
.

peterson
(
2001
)
had   mentions   Vt
mentioned   mentions   Vt
that
an   -   ArtOrDet
aging
process
in
a
country
will
cause
-   a   ArtOrDet
shrinking
workforce
,
long-term
stagnation
and
decrease
in
real
gdp
.

despite   Nevertheless   Trans
it   Nevertheless   Trans
,
these
problems
could
be
eliminated
as
the
influx
of
foreigners
through
immigration
will
satisfy
the
needs
of

labour
market
and
to   -   Rloc-
boost
the
economy
with
improved
labour
productivity
.

in
the
past
,
operations
were
performed
on
individual   individuals   Nn
in
a
very
crude
manner
.

-   The   ArtOrDet
straits
time
(
2009
)
mentioned
that
the
huge
increases
in
public
spending
could
slow
down
countries

economic

.

in
addition
,
their
new
designs
will
address
safety
issues
.

in
singapore
-   ,   Mec
for
instance
,
the
government
is
not
the
sole
party
that
is
responsible
in   for   Prep
supporting
the
ageing
population
.

meanwhile
,
in
a
study

out   -   Rloc-
less
than
5
%
of
the
current
elderly
population
rely
on
cpf
disbursements
for
their

.

if
the
government
raises
tax
to
finance
the
expenses
on
aged
,
-   's   Npos
the
younger
generation
would
even
face
difficulties
making
a
living
.

the
use
of
rfid
to
track
people
is
against
human
rights
and
violates
one
's
privacy
.

some

argued   argue   Vt
that
even
though
there
is
no
radioactive
waste
of   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-

the

this

so
for

a

from
the
evidence
i
have
collected

i
have
come

a   the   ArtOrDet
conclusion
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
sodium-cooled

is
a
better
choice
than
-   the   ArtOrDet
lead-cooled

as
it
outperforms
the
latter
in
three

which
are
safety
,
performance

beg
to

this
is
certainly
a
very
large
demographic
number
for
the
governing
states
to
deny
support
because
public
spending
,
on
the
aged
,
if
limited
,
will
incur
more
disadvantages
than
advantages
,
not
only
to
the
aged
who
will
be
directly
affected
,
but
also
to
the
overall
society
as
a
whole
due
to
the
fact
that
the   -   ArtOrDet

in

some
may
say
that

is
dangerous
,
after
seeing   experiencing   Wci
those   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear

this
is

nevertheless
,
the

the

for

the

what

as

why

this
is
because
of
three
reasons
:
an
increasing
spending
in
dealing
with
problems
in   with   Prep
regard
to
-   an   ArtOrDet
aging
population
would
probably
affect
other

;
government   the   ArtOrDet

the

the

it

which

hence
,
spending
on
pension
and
retraining
for
the
elders   elderly   Wform
is
essential
and
should
not
be
limited
as
it
aids
them
in
being
financially
independent
after

.

with
so
many
things
to
consider
about   -   Rloc-

those   -   Pform

do
have
reasons

before
they
risk
the

in

both

although

are
already
starting
to

thus
,
it

to
notify

so
that
early
recognition

if

from
these
two
examples
above   -   Rloc-
,
it
is
clear
that
another
similarity
between
conventional
technology
and
serendipitous
technology
is
the
process
of
development
and
commercialization
which
involved   involve   Vt
a

hence
,
engineering
should
consider

in

the

and
no

become
a
big
financial

engineers
have
overcome
the
difficulties
on
cost

and

.

the
``
natural
''
factor
that
caused
-   in   Prep
a
spike
in
the
number
of
gasoline-powered
vehicles
was
the
declining
cost
of

at
that
point

which
made
gasoline-powered
vehicles
a
stronger
competitor
to
the
electric-powered

which
were
the
more
commonly-
used
vehicle
.

in

prevent
such
accidents

happening

suggested   should   Vm

this
can
be
shown
as
many
researchers
were
lamenting
on
the
shutdown
of
the

located
in
chalk
river
,
ontario
,
and
their
medical
research
has   had   Vt
to
be
put
to
a

(

.

however

consequently
,
companies
choose
to
import
or

them
from
other
country   countries   Nn
instead
of
develop   developing   Wci
on
their

.

according
to
the
article
,
``
world
's
most
congested

''   -   Cit
(
robert

,
2006
)
,
there
are
about
750

in

at

this
would

one
of
the
concerns
is
that
the   -   ArtOrDet

need
to
spend

when

a

she

after

almost
double

nuclear

of
the
most
possible   viable   Wci
solutions

the

basically   -   ArtOrDet
combined
the

,
but
it
was
a
great
success
and
everybody
uses

although
in
a   the   Wci

the

therefore
,
the
pro-natalist
is
rather
unsuccessful
in

through

due

the

thus
the

with
an
idea

thus
,
it
is
justifiable
that

the

we   they   Wtone

one
of   is   Vt
the
most
direct
ways
of
dealing
with
the
problems
is
to
divert
more

one
example
is
the

the
national

for

in
the

the

that
more

million
women
chose
to
have
cosmetic
plastic
surgery
in

and
there
is
an
uphill
trend
over

so
,
the
treatment

in

the

there

the

did

which

could
be

it

their

seek

when

more

means
that
the

therefore
,
it
is
critical
to
spend
more

to
develop
the

's

rather
to
adhere
to
the

of

bear

in

today
,
there
are

lie

in
conclusion
,
our
current
policies
clearly
have
helped
to
ease

secondly
we
need
to
gather
more
information

like

failed
attempts
of

whether

therefore
,
after
considering
all
the
factors
,
i
agree
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
as
other
factors
are
equally
important
in   , such as   Srun
taking
care

thus

we

this

fortunately

plenty

plenty

with

in

the

did
not
usually

traveling   to travel   Wci
for

there
is
a
psychological
perception
of
having

one
of
them
is
the
introduction
of

in

these

share   improving   Vform
several

to
achieve
this
,
money
has
to
be
channelled
to   into   Prep
the   -   ArtOrDet
research

area   -   Rloc-
instead
of
spending
excessively
on
the

the
tourism

posted
high
revenue
of
s
$
14.8
billion
in
2008
,
a
4.8
%
increase
from

in
conclusion
,
we
should
prohibit

in

,
-   the   ArtOrDet
singapore
government
has
seriously
looked
into
the
needs
of
the   its   ArtOrDet
senior
citizens
and
the

moreover

under
most
circumstances
,
one
needs
to
bride   bribe   Mec
in
order
to
accomplish
his
or
her
objective
.

however
,
heber
(
2008
)
has
explained
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
fact
of
the
slow
process   progress   Wci
in
the
new
designs
of
swcr
is
due
to
the
great
emphasize   emphasis   Wform
over
the
overall
safety
performances
of
the
nuclear
plants
.

therefore
,
retraining
is
needed
for
the
elderly
as
through
these   -   ArtOrDet
retraining
,
they
can
upgrade
their
skills
and
adapt
to
the
demanding
working
environment
to
save
up   -   Rloc-
for
the
future
and
contribute
to
the
economy
.

compulsory
savings
implemented
in
certain   aside   Wci
countries
such
as
britain
,
australia
and
singapore
help
ensure
that
the
people
have
enough
savings
to
meet
their
retirement
needs
.

it
is
also
against
human
rights
to
leave
a
helpless
person
to
be
tortured
by
illnesses
and
-   then leave him to   Sfrag
die
.

fear
causes
psychological
problems
such
as
anxiety
and
the
lost   loss   Wform
of
a
person
's
confident   confidence   Wform
.

in
order
to
compensate
and
preserve
the
right   e   Um
of   e   Um
nature   e   Um
,
there
is
a
need
to
implement
a
system
whereby
waster   waste   Wform
construction
materials
can
be
treated
and
re-used
.

although
hospitals
are
built
to
cater
for
the
elderly
and
medical
science
is
advancing
,
the
most
critical
issue
is
still
regarding   -   Rloc-
the
high
medical
cost
that
patients
and
families
have
to
worry
upon   about   Wci
.

since
it
is
a
new
technology
,
there   -   Rloc-
are   -   Rloc-
still   -   Rloc-
many
refinements
that   -   Rloc-
could
-   still   Trans
be
made
.

the
income
assessment
overlooks
details
such
as
a
family
having
more
than
one
elderly
-   person   Wci
that
requires
medical
attention
as   -   Rloc-
well   -   Rloc-
.

moreover
,
with
current
technology
advancement
,
we
-   the   ArtOrDet
can
tackle
the
physical
barriers
of
aging
problems
such
as
low
birth
rate
,
increased
productivity
and
reduced
physical
effects
of
aging
,
which
may
partly
attribute
to
elderly
low
self-esteem
.

without
any
of
these
three
factors
,
the
dream
of
owning
a
laptop
will   would   Vm
be
still
a
dream
now
.

life
will
be
sheer
torturing   torture   Wform
instead
of
enjoying   enjoyment   Wform
.

thirdly
,
it
is
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
.

for   In   Wci
a
country
-   ,   Srun
money
should
be
diverted
to
other
areas
like
defense
,   and   Trans
improving   -   Rloc-
infrastructure
-   ;   Mec
and
thus
-   ,   Srun
public
spending
should   on the aged should be limited   WOadv
be   on the aged should be limited   WOadv
limited   on the aged should be limited   WOadv
on   on the aged should be limited   WOadv
the   on the aged should be limited   WOadv
aged   on the aged should be limited   WOadv
in
order
to
get
better
returns
and   -   Um
to   -   Um
excel   -   Um
in   -   Um
the   -   Um
world   -   Um
.

however   For   Rloc-
,   For   Rloc-
not
all
elderly
people
are
willing
to
participate
in
such
events
.

unfortunately
,
this
scheme
can
not
be
adequately
applied
.

in
conclusion
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
lfr
has
much
to
offer
to
mankind
especially
in
terms
of
safety
,
security
,
sustainability
as
well
as
environmental
effects
.

for
those
who
successfully
designed
their
products
,
they
are
met
with
another
problem
-   --   Mec
the
lack
of
facilities
to

and
the
inflexibility
of

today

his
invention
has   -   Vt
become
a
necessity
in
our
life
to
fulfill
our
need
to
communicate
without

for

,
a
local

who
is
suffering
from
kennedy

,
has
revealed
his   -   Rloc-

the

his
genetic
disease
.

moreover
uranium
is
limited
in

and
not
as
abundant
as
thorium   thorium   Mec
.

secondly
,
surveillance
-   a   ArtOrDet
technology
has
been
proven
to
be
effective
for
social
control
as
it
helps
to
monitor
those
who
needs
special
attention
such
as
alzheimer

patients
.

comparing   Compared   Vt
with

instead
,
they   age   Vt
should

we

begin
with

how   examine   V0

on

to

up

answers

question

those
who
took   take   Vform
this

are
actually
discriminating
against

groundless
basis
,
and
removing

this
is
also
one
point
that

but
the

that

manner
which
assured
that

at

move

without

policy

that
it

that

would
``
impoverish

with

all

the

to

means
the   -   ArtOrDet
progressive

to

the

to
suffer   -   Rloc-
from   -   Rloc-
illnesses
,
immobility
and
short   lack   Wci
of
money
for

.

however
,
this
would
be
tantamount
to
saying
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
is
responsible
to   for   Wci
``
feed   feeding '' th   Wform

the

however

that

in

the

has
insufficient

lastly

implanting

their

will
thus
lift

out

therefore
,
the
final
say
should
not

since

why

we

it
may
be
objected   argued   Wci
that
the

which
is
not
saved
for

can
be
better
spent
elsewhere

a

however

the

we

this
is
the
intention

in

(

.

one
might
object
here   -   Srun
that
the
government
and
society
have
not
really
done
much
for
them
.

moreover
,
when
the
government
provide   provides   SVA
support
for
medical
and
social
spending
,
it
will
allow
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
to
have
enough
money
to
spend
for
their
other
leisure
activities
.

``
hydrogen-powered
buses
in

japan
have
already
been
successful

and
about
50
prototype
cars
both
thermal-combustion
and
fuel-cell
types
have
so
far
been
tested
,
with
good
results
.

however
,
nowadays
the   -   ArtOrDet
scientists
have
proved
that
with
measured
cautions   caution   Nn
,
nuclear
power
could
be
used
to

however
,
the
public
possessed   professes   Wci
strong
opposition
against
the
building
of
nuclear

next
i
will
illustrate
more
in

how
engineering

can
meet
that
need
by
using

of
a

that
should

in
conclusion
,
the
most

may
not

for

,
the

the   -   Sfrag

thus
this
might

by

nevertheless

the
issue
on

is
taken
care
very   of   Trans

as
far
as
i   had   Wtone
am
concerned
,
the
two
problems
are
crucial
as
one
refers
to
the
beginning
of
innovation
and
the
other
determines
the
destiny
of
this

while
psychological
change

to
the
change
in

behaviors

for
the   -   ArtOrDet
example
-   ,   Mec
of
singapore
at
the
beginning
of
the
nation
building
,
education
was
one
of
the
priorities

as
it
not
only
increase
the
skill
level
of

,
it
also
bring

in
this
way
,
there   -   Rloc-
is   -   Rloc-
a   -   Rloc-
controlling   -   Rloc-
factor   -   Rloc-
in   -   Rloc-

it
obviously
means
that
the
rest
fifty-seven
percents   percent   Nn
in
the
first
case
or
two
third   thirds   Nn
of
the

in
the
second
case
have
to
work
and
support

both
themselves
and
those
who
are
unable
to
work
.

in
the
process
of
inventing
a
laptop
,
the
design
team
was
lack   lacking in   Wci
of   lacking in   Wci
human
resource
and
money
.

the
idea   arose   Wci
of
making
a
laptop
was
inspired
by
mainly
three
social
factors
:
demand
of
customers
,
support
of
technical
stuff

and
source
of
funding
.

to

schemes

furthermore
,
not

has   have   SVA
the
discipline
to

healthy

balance
given
the

world

therefore
,
we
should
take
into
consideration
the
effects   problems   Wci
that
we
will
encounter
in
the
long
run
.

this
``

is
designed
to
provide
comfort
and
companionship
to

who
are
lonely
or
shut
in

as
stated
by

in
``

design
process
,
2005
''
,
consumers
are
the
one
that
ultimately
establish   their   Pform
the
need
for
a
product
.

to
narrow
down
the
topic
,
this
essay   to   Prep
is
mainly
to
test
current
r
&
d
,
as
well
as
government
policies
in
china
dealing
with
the
aging
process
.

in
addition
,
it
is
the
responsibilities   responsibility   Nn
of
the
elderly
as
well
as
the
working

to
plan

for
their
future

on
the
other
hand
,
it
is
plausible
to
reward
families
-   the   ArtOrDet
for
having
children
and
enable
more
young
people
to
work
.

hence
-   ,   Mec
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
,
but
not
completely
ignored
.

the
funds
could
go
to
many
different
types
of
industries
for
research
and
development
purposes
.

recently
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
singapore
prime
minister
,
mr
lee
hsein

had   -   Vt
stressed

]   -   Cit
during
his

therefore
,
the
elderly
will
be
more   -   Rloc-
encouraged
to
be
independent
and
self
sufficient
.

furthermore
,

second   Secondly   Trans
,
people
today
are
more
aware
of
the
effect
of
healthy
living
on
their
life
expectancy
.

publicizing
an

can
bring
about
big

to   such as   Trans
the   having to face   Others

as   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
government   -   Rloc-
introduces
programme
for

,
they
will
happily
leave
the
problem
to
the

.

alzheimer

or
alzheimer
disease
is
the
most
common
form
of
dementia
mostly
diagnosed

people

65

consequently
,
singapore   contributed   Vt
needs
to
import
water
from
neighboring
countries
such
as
malaysia
to
meet
its
needs
(

.

instead
,
the
government
needs
to
recognize
the
efforts
contributed
by
the
elderly
in
national   nation   Nn
building
.

in
fact
,
the
scientists
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
soviet
union
were
equipped
with
deep
technical
knowledge

but
they
were
more

to

the

give   has given   Vt
rises   rise   Nn
to
the   an   ArtOrDet
aging
population
.

while
conventional
research
requires
the
researchers
to
do
large
amount   -   Vt
of
reports
,
discussions
and
management
procedures
,
skunkwork
provides

to
develop

quickly
without

the
solution
to

is
the
harnessing

although
funding
of   for   Prep
healthcare
services
for
the
elderly
is
essential
,
it
should
be
limited
and
diverted
to
other
areas
,
especially
baby

.

there
is
too
much
human
factor
involved
when
it
comes
to
whether
elders
should   it   Pform
get
more
funds
to
help
them
cope
in
their
later
days
,
which
should
not
be
part
of
any
equation
when
other
development
sectors
can
benefit
instead
.

as
a
result
the   -   ArtOrDet
cng
vehicle
technology
is
shaped
by
the   -   ArtOrDet
government
policies
.

as
a
result
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
employers
and
insurance
companies
should
have
the
rights   right   Nn
to
request

from

who

a

interpretation
of

engineering
design
processes
consists
of
five
different
stages
starting
with
defining
the
problem
,
followed   -   Rloc-
by   -   Rloc-
gathering
pertinent
information
,
generating
multiple
solutions
,
analyzing
and
selecting
a
solution
and
finally
testing
and
implementing
the
solutions
.

indeed
,
there
are
always
some

in
cities
around
the
world
,
-   a   ArtOrDet
large
amount
of
energy
are   is   SVA
consumed
by
electrical
appliances
every
day
.

on
an
individual
basis
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
are
ill-equipped
to
withstand
the
possibility
of
contracting
a
terminal
disease
,
from
the
calculations
from
-   the   ArtOrDet
ministry
of
health
(
2009
)
,
a

2,227
treatment
bill
on   for   Prep
heart
attack   treatment   Wci
is
likely
to
devastate
most
retirees
.

another
rebuttal
against
applying
psychology
is
that
some
people
argue
that
design
errors
is   are   SVA
the
main
cause
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
major
engineering
accidents
,
and
applying
psychology
can
not
correct
these
design
errors
and   nor   Trans
prevent
the
accidents
.

nevertheless
,
with
the
extra
pump
in
money
given
in
these
examples   for   Prep
,
better
service
will
be
provided
for
the
aged
.

however
,
although
these
job
fairs
provide
more
working
opportunities
for
the
elderly
,
the
success
of
such
job
fairs
is
largely
dependent
on
the
receptiveness
of
the

expectations

the   -   ArtOrDet

,
they
have
defined
the
problem

which
is
the   -   ArtOrDet

they
have

the

the

makes
it
difficult
for

singapore
government
not
to
increase

allocate
more

considering
all
the
points

i
would
very

that

with

some

the   -   ArtOrDet

neglect

the   -   ArtOrDet

unless

besides
it
also
allows
the

be
more
self-sufficient
after

retire

during

have
to
reserve

another

is
that

therefore

therefore

that

can   the   ArtOrDet

alternatively

in

singapore
has
a

and
a

to

from
this

hopefully
,
it

when

to
partly
offset
this

,
china

however

can

finally
,
building

of   -   Rloc-
infrastructure
-   that   Pref
caters
to
the
elders   elderly   Wform
will
help
a
country
prepare
for
the

.

the
high
retail
price
of
car
will
significantly
affect
the
decision
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
committee
to
commercialize
the
product
as
consumer
would
not
pay
much
for
it
.

according
to
the
world
association
of
nuclear
operators
(

)
,
the   -   Rloc-

that

in

however
,
recently
,
many
found   when a   SVA
that
the
amount
is
insufficient
to
keep
up
with
the
rising
cost
of
medical
fees
,
resulting
in
the
use
of
the
children

.

in
cases
where
the
elder   elderly   Wci
do
not
have
any
children
or
-   do not have any   Spar
saving
left
,
money
is
also
needed
to
cater
for
their
daily
expenses

and
medical
expenses
.

thus
,
-   have   V0
there
is
no
need
to
fear
when
there
is
no

done
.

this
is
because
as
people
grow
older
,
most   many   Wci
are
bound
to
suffer
from
age-related
diseases
such
as
alzheimer

and

thus
,
a
large
amount
of
money
can
be   fuel   Wform
saved

on
the
other
hand
,
some
important
departments
need
strict

taking
singapore
as

,
just
after

another

has

therefore
,
the

has
to
choose
the
most

areas
to

alternatively
,
they
can
stay

therefore
,
by
increasing
the
retirement

and
recruiting
immigrants
,
we
have
partly
eased
the
economic
aspect
of

genetic

as
one
of

in
conclusion

economic

these   Although these initiatives   WOinc
initiatives   Although these initiatives   WOinc
although   Although these initiatives   WOinc
are
beneficial
for

,
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
should
consider
limiting
public
spending
on
them
to
divert
money
to
other
areas
such
as
education
and
development
in
singapore
.

this
control
makes
the
gas-cooled
fast

can   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
as
safe
as
the
sodium-cooled
fast

.

with

can

and
also

salary
and
terms
.

without
healthcare
benefits
for
the
aged
such
as
subsidized
medical
fees   -   ArtOrDet
,
most
elderly
are
unlikely
to
afford
the

medical

incurred
.

with   High   Rloc-

research
on
this
aspect
of

would
have
been
possible
and
hence
would
have

with

to   -   ArtOrDet
safety
,
the

has
certain
desirable
safety
measures
under
both
normal
and
extreme
conditions

one
of
the
major
growth
engines
in
the
singapore
's
economy
is
the
manufacturing
sector
.

according
to
general
housing
survey
2005
,
there
is   are   SVA
around
22,000
elderly
-   people   Others
living
alone
.

another
problem
is
that
most
elderly
in
developed
countries
live
alone
;
they
do
not
want
to
ask
for
money
from
the
children
,
which
mean   means   Vm
that
they
will
not
receive
sufficient
financial
and
mental
support
from
their
children
.

apparently
,
some
aged   persons   Others
will
try
to
abuse
the
public
spending
policy
.

the
golden
generation
itself
will
be
happier
since
they
will
not
feel
to   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
useless
or
abandoned

this

reasons

firstly
,
the

many   -   Rloc-

the

both

believe
that

of
its

being
looked
at

therefore
,
i
hold
the
point   -   Mec
that

cheaper

of

.

moreover
,
early
detection
can
lead
to
a   telling   Wform
lower

this
is
due
to
the
lack
of

opportunities
and
not
because
of
the   talent   Nn
lack

another

thus
,

has
to
continue

uranium

have   has   SVA
been
constantly
upgrading
and
implementing
new
strategies
to
help
ease
the
aging
process
.

the
three
developments
and
policies
highlighted
are
examples
of
the
efforts
made
to
help
ease
the
ageing
process
for
the
elderly
by
helping
them
keep
themselves
relevant
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
society
and
their
family
.

thereby   Therefore   Wci
,
sodium-cooled
fast
reactors
are
very
safe
and
also
safer
than
the
other
reactors
in
the
fourth
generation
.

if
the
way
to
operate
a
product
is
complicated
,   -   Rloc-
human   -   Rloc-
will   -   Rloc-
prefer   -   Rloc-
not   -   Rloc-
to
use
it
because
the
time
spent
in
operating
the
product
is
not
worth
to
be
wasted
.

when
the
children
live   -   ArtOrDet
near
their
parents
,
there
is
a
higher
probability
of
them
visiting
their
parents
often
,
hence
making
it
easier
for
them
to
take
care
of
their
parents
.

the
radioactive
waste
can
also
be   going   Wci
sustainably
used
in
the
fuel
cycle
with
reduction
of
environmental
burden

however

however
,
base   based   Vt
on
research
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
usage
of
the

system
can
help
to
reduce
duplication
and
error
in
medical
prescription

resulting
in
a

be

it
can
be

are
enthusiastic

these

form

a
group
to

out
the

and
this
kind
of
groups
are
called
``

''
.

moreover
,
this
research
also
showed   shows   Vt
that

reduced

despite   -   Cit
the   -   Cit

in

there
is
actually
one
similarity
between

pro-natalist   A pronatalist   ArtOrDet
policy
has
been
implemented
since
-   the   ArtOrDet
early
1990s
-   , and   Srun
yet
the
effectiveness
it
has
on
birth
remains
questionable
.

to
have
environmentally-friendly
product   products   Nn
is
a
human
need
that
has
to
be
given
priority
,
so
that
the
products
people
use
wo
n't
be
harmful
to
neither
the
environment
nor
-   the   ArtOrDet
health
of
people

have

perhaps
the

countries   All countries   Pref
want
to
build

that
are
cheap

expanding

a

strategy
to

considering
the
economics   economies   Wform
of

,
the
cost
of
building
materials
such

will
increase
significantly
,
hence
the
size
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
nuclear
plant
has
become
a
consideration
.

besides
that
,
it
can
supply
detailed
body

to

and
then

public
can
alter
their

after

it
might
be
true

we

also
consider
that

this

of

apparently
,
it
is
not
the
elderly
but
the
young   younger   Wform
generation
that
is
the
``

''
of

the

first

even

there
is
not   no   Wci
dispute
that

which   Increased life expectancy   Pref

only
one

in

the

the

the

in

and
despite

nuclear

the

so

therefore

however

it
must
be
noted
that

not
many

are
willing

furthermore

hence

the

some

thus

this

to
elaborate

the

also
,
the

allows

with

,

may
end
up
migrating

other

causing
a
brain

.

however
,
the
increase

means
that

higher

,
as

this

the

the

applying
the

may
make

more

slow

for

in

it

the

solutions
such
as
having

implemented
to
ease

with

the

probably

a

nevertheless
,
it
does
not
mean
that
whatever   every   Wci

can
be
made   turned into a product   Others

human

analyze

and
remind

the
important
factors
that
they

since
the

,
steam

which
will

only   The only   ArtOrDet

as

at

,
with

the

would

increase

a
research
done
by
-   the   ArtOrDet
swiss

reported
that

however
,
all
these

do
not
do

what
to
emphasize
is
that
the
choice
includes
both
possibilities
of

and   part of   Wci
revealing   part of   Wci
the
findings
.

instead
,
just
following
others
is   has   Vt
proved
to
be
more
profitable
sometimes
.

the
first
-   possible   Others
off
solution
is
to
provide
genetically
modified
seeds
and

to
the
farmers
,
so
that
they
will
obtain

transportation
which
is

environmentally
friendly
and
uses
alternative

-   ,   Mec
has
the
utmost
importance
in
the
need
of
transportation
.

thanks
to
the
improvement
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
core
design
,
less
average
core

will
be
required
so
that
the
possibility
of
devastating
accidents
such
as
-   the   ArtOrDet
core
melting
down
happened   -   Rloc-
will
become
extremely
slim
;   .   Mec
and   Moreover ,   Trans
because
-   of   Trans
the
dedicated
moderator
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
,
the
boiling
crisis
of
coolants
under
normal
operating
conditions
can
be   also be   WOadv
also   also be   WOadv
eliminated

for

by
doing
so
,
the
government
is
able
to
concentrate
on
those
who
really
require
the
aiding   help   Wci
.

individuals
will
tend
to
keep
the

are
afraid
that

burden
and
will
cause

understanding

will

with
the
current
policies
such

upgrading

,
the

has
been
eased
to
a

however
,
not

the

first
and

,
the

remain   are   Wci
financially

in

and
need

due

the

thus
caused   causing   Vform

the

based
on

roger

on
``

,
a

main
stages

this
will
lighten
the
financial

easing

as
they
can

they   This   Wci
suggest   This   Wci
that
if
there
had

a
better
team
of

involved
in
the
design
process
,
they
would
have
worked
in
an
effective
and
productive
manner
and
would
have
been
able
to
come
up
with
a
better
piece
of
design
for
the

thus
,
preventing
the
accident

with
the
more   increasing   Wci
and   increasing   Wci
more   increasing   Wci
collaboration
between

and

,
the   -   ArtOrDet

for
the

to
make

that

looking

we

tell

in

,
until

not

with

there

hence
,
it
should
not

therefore
,
further

are
essential

the

in

in

the

worries

some

others
are

furthermore
,
it
is
unfair
to
discriminate

we
can

some

therefore
,
all
our

is
at

however
-   ,   Mec
the
point
here   -   Rloc-
i
would
like
to
make
here
is
this
.

these
problems
that
may
hamper
the   -   ArtOrDet
engineering
design
would
impact
the
market
causing
the
unavailability
of
new
products
,
designers
taking
shortcuts
in

and
changing   designers '   Others
mindsets
about

.

in
the
last
step
of

,
political
issues
-   can   Vm
also
disturb   disrupt   Wci
the
process
significantly
.

with
those   these   Pform
little
extra
efforts
provided
by
the
company
,
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
those   the   ArtOrDet
aged
people
to
ride
mrt
or
public

.

this
policy
provides
the

therefore
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
illegal
copy
phenomena
restrict   restricts   SVA
the
development
of
the   -   ArtOrDet

in

however
,
this
does
not

we
should
forgo
any

the

furthermore
it
does
not
help
much
in

if

provide
too

for

there
are
certain
differences
and

between
these
two
.

its

is

contrained
them
from
joining
in

and
unintentionally
stole
the
essential
fundamentals
for

afterwards
.

in
this
example
,
it
was
proved   in the   Others
that
the
conventional
process
of

won
the
competition

this
can
prove
to
be

in

if
the

still

the

will

be
drained

this   This   Mec

in

there

in

should

,
with

the

it
does

on

on
the
minor
scale   viewed   Wci
,
it
is
the
individual
themselves
who
are
abusing
such
technology
for
their

the
first
problem

the

does
not

in
my
opinion

,
there

no
future
for

because
:
chances
of
an
accident
which
will
release
radioactive
waste
into
the
atmosphere
is
too
high
,
there
are
still
no
safe
solutions
for
the
growing
pile
of
deadly
radioactive
wastes
,
and
reprocessing
of
this
energy
is
dirty
,
dangerous
and
costly
.

however
,
it
does
not
favour
the
technological
development
.

the
increase
in
life

and
decline
in

are
-   the   ArtOrDet
two
main
causes

if

the

the
production
of
nuclear

does
not
have
carbon

as
a
by-product
,   ;   Srun
thus
it
can
reduce
the

which
is
the
reason

many
other

like

thus
,
in

view
,
there
are
much
better

so
there
should
be
more

nevertheless
,
although
the

it

not

thus

therefore

under

the

an

(
repeated
idea

this
solution
seems
to
have
been
adapted
fairly
well
by
the
singapore
's   -   Mec
government
since
the
beginning
of
the
21st
century
,
and
the
immigrant
workers
have
been
closely
associated
with
the
economic
development
of
the
country
.

due
to
the
fact
that
it
may
not
be
very
realistic
for
those
people
who
are
already
very
old
,
disabled
or
need
much
medical
care
to
be
very
productive
,
some
other
ways
shall
be
combined
to
handle   tackle the problem of   Wci
aging
population
.

in
conclusion
,
the
human
need
for
the
innovation
of
an
environmental-friendly
car
must
be
given
priority
to
reduce
the   and   Trans
effect
of
worldwide
climate
change
;
and
the
engineering
design
processes
is
a
systematic
method
to
accomplish
this
objective
systematically
.

besides
companies
being   are   Vt
influenced
by
potential
profitability
and
having
gained
access
to
better
funding
,
social
factors
also
played   play   Vt
a
part
.

furthermore
,
it
is
not
guaranteed   assured   Wci
that
all
people   -   Rloc-
are
able
to
save
up
money
during
their
young   younger   Wform
days
.

usually
when
you   a country   Wci
are   creates   Vt
creating   creates   Vt
nuclear
power
,
the
main
purpose
is
to
make
other
countries

and

.

in
conclusion
,
in
terms
of   has   Vt
safety
,
efficiency
and
cost
,
the
new
concept
of
vhtr
is
the
best
design
and
the
first
choice
for
the
nuclear
industry
.

the
increase
in
fuel
efficiency
will
reduce
operational
cost
since
there
will
be
lesser   less   Wform
need
for
storage
of

radioactive

products
.

although
the
elderly
are
prone
to
illnesses
and
more
funds
are
required   for them   Others
as
compared
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
younger
employees
in
an
organisation
,
they
have
the
experience
to
guide
the
younger
employees
.

first
of
all
,
judging   -   Rloc-
this   -   Rloc-
issue   -   Rloc-
from   -   Rloc-
one   -   Rloc-
particular   -   Rloc-
angle   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
it
is
commonly
believed
that
-   a   ArtOrDet
well-funded
life
which
rises   arises   Wci
from
economic
success
will
help
people
to
be   -   Rloc-
able   -   Rloc-
to   -   Rloc-
purchase
sufficient
food
for
their
own
demands   consumption   Wci
.

the
second
strategy
implemented
is
the
raise
of   in   Prep
the
retirement
age
to
sixty
two
years
old
.

this
recycling
system
makes
it
more
environmental-friendly   environmentally-friendly   Wform
than
others   other reactors   Others
.

recent   In recent   Wci
years
,
many
asian
countries
such
as
japan
,
south
korea
,
hong

and
singapore
are   have been   Vt
tackling
with   -   Prep
a
long
term
issue
-
-   a   ArtOrDet
burgeoning
ageing
population
,
which
is
the   a   ArtOrDet
repercussion
from   of   Prep
rapid
economy   economic   Wform
development
,
with
high
quality
of
health
care
but
-   a   ArtOrDet
relatively
low
fertility
rate
.

therefore
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
definitely
has
to
be
limited
,
ensuring
enough
funding
goes
to
other
sectors
such
as
education
,
military
,
technology
,
transport
,
housing
,
healthcare
,
sports
,
etc
which
are
equally
important
and   so as   Trans
also   so as   Trans
not
to
increase
taxes
for
the
working
population
.

lastly
,
surveillance
technology
like
cctv
cameras
does
not
decrease
the
crime
rate
.

it

and
-   the   ArtOrDet

down

(

therefore
,
if
a

shows

concern
about

,
it
is
very

that

hence
,
some

-   they   Pref
do

the

in

fact
that

,
the

goes   applies   Wci
to

this
however
is
not

as

increase

for   Firstly   Wci

even   It could even   Others

if
the

it
is
more
likely
that
the

in

so

another

in

,
most
of

current
policies
in
easing

process
have
their
limitation   limitations   Nn
or

the

is
,
thus
,
fast

in

in
the

maintain

launched
in

in

with
the
aim
of
allowing

and
to

(

.

a
report
published
by
iaea
nuclear
safety
advisory
group
stated
that
the
actual   ;   Srun
causes
were
due
to
design
errors
.

therefore
exposure
to
definition
of
problems
is
not
greater   extensive   Wci
enough
to
let   allow   Wci
students
to
find
other
possible
problems

on
the

hand
,
conventional

technology
probably
takes

time

for
example
,
another

besides
,
it

nuclear

however
,
it
seems
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
information

is
not
very
popular
among
the

.

as
we
know
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
the
storage
and
transport
of

have
been
two

factors
that
restrict

in
conclusion
,
the
aging
population
is
increasing
and
with
it   attempt   SVA
comes
slower
economic
growth
for
countries
.

therefore
,
individuals
should
inform
their
loved
ones
of
their
situations
so
that
they
can
help
each
other
through
the
difficult
times
.

in
conclusion
,
even

the

of

aging
population
is
important
,
we   other areas that are essential to a country 's development can not be neglected   Wtone

in

undoubtedly
,
the   -   ArtOrDet

but
this
should

another   -   Rloc-

most

come
to
a

that

thus
,
nuclear

not

limiting

may
in

bring
about

lastly
,

the

therefore
,
instead
of

into

nursing

,
it
would
be
wiser
for

plan

more

as

does
not
have
its

natural

,
we
can
develop
new
ways
to
gain
these
resources
in

to
be
self

in
the
end
-   the   ArtOrDet
productivity

it

as

to

knowledge

is
important

at

still
continues

to

for

the

are
encouraged
to
have

(

introduces
six
strategies
for
policy
reforms
to
ease
the
aging
process
,
one
of
which
is
to
reduce
elderly
dependency
by
encouraging
later
retirement
.

other
areas
of
development
included   include   Vt
addressing
social
issues
such
as
the
decrease
in
the
birthrate
and
the
increase
in
child
abuse
cases
.

advance   -   Rloc-

planning
allows
the   -   ArtOrDet
people
to
provide
for
themselves
when
they
have
retired
or
-   are   V0
incapable
of
supporting
themselves
financially
.

so
now
we
should
not
only
consider
the   -   ArtOrDet
economic
profit
but
the   -   ArtOrDet
sustainable
development
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
human
society
.

the
consultant
might
also
advise
the
children
of
the
old
person
to
keep
the
elderly
company
regularly
and
care
more
about
him   them   Pform
.

one
day
the

wanted
to
find
some
medicine
called

elixir

opponents
also
argue
that
the
gen

and
gen
iii
reactors
have
already
achieved
excellent
performance   in   Prep
,
so
it
is
not

to

however
,   -   Cit
we   -   Cit
can
always
organize
campaigns
to
educate
our
elder
population
to
direct
them
to
enjoy
these
benefits
,
allowing
the
government
to
limit
their
expenditure
on
the
aged
.

in
the
history
of
warfare
,
these
are
the
only
two
nuclear
weapons
used
for   in the offensive   Wci
attacking   in the offensive   Wci
.

according
to
one
of   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
research
conducted
by
the
natural
marketing
institute
(
nmi
)
[

]
,
memory
loss
and
losing
brain
capacity
is
the
biggest
fear
of
the
aging
baby
boomer
population
.

all
these
developments
do   -   Rloc-
not   -   Rloc-
only   -   Rloc-
help
the
elderly
but   ,   Mec
also   ,   Mec
the
disabled
and
pregnant
women
as
well
,   . Thus ,   Srun
thus   . Thus ,   Srun
developments
in
these
area
is   are   SVA
definitely
worthwhile
.

we
can
not
deny
it
and   ;   Srun
for
example
,
on
26th
of
april
,
1986
,
the
nuclear
reactor
in
chernobyl
,
ukraine
leaked
and
exploded
and   -   Rloc-
caused   -   Rloc-
extremely   -   Rloc-
serious   -   Rloc-
accidents   -   Rloc-
.

from
the
examples
in   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
context   -   Rloc-
above
,
we
can
conclude
that
generally
,
the
development
of
technology
is
determined
by
both
technological
factors
as
well
as
social
factors
.

in
conclusion
,
there
are
significant
differences
between
technologies
developed
from
research
and
serendipitous
discovery
,   ;   Srun
however
,
it   these differences   Pref
does
not
change
the
fact
that
they   both technologies   Pref
are
key
to
the
future
for
mankind
.

for
example
,
infrastructure
is
a
real
need
for
those
living
in
the
rural
villages
in
asia
but
-   with   Mec
not
for
the
nomads
in
africa
,
although
both
groups
are
affected
by
poverty
.

who   -   Wtone
knows   -   Wtone
,   -   Wtone
may   Perhaps   Wci
be   Perhaps   Wci
in
a
few
years
-   '   Mec
time
,
the
real
cure
for
influenza
virus
will
be
discovered
serendipitously
and
till
that
day
,
influenza
virus
will
no   continue to   Wci
longer   continue to   Wci
be
a
threat
to
us
.

the
loss
of
privacy
and
the
potential
social
discrimination
involved
are
still
the
main
concerns
of
the
public
.

some
people
may
argue
that
it
is
unfair
to
use
of   -   Prep
genetic
tests
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
recruitment
of
employees
or   -   Rloc-
job   -   Rloc-
applicants   -   Rloc-
because
it
is
treating
people
discriminatively
based
on
-   a   ArtOrDet
fixed
characteristic
(
andre
,
velasquez
,
n.d.
)
.

humankind
has
been
inventing
more
effective
and
useful
equipments
by
applying
advanced
techniques
.

therefore
,
support
of
further
research
and
development
funding
for
nuclear   nuclear   Mec
power
should
not
be
continued
.

this
is
supported
by
jones
(
1995
)
,
stating
that
the
increasing   increase   Wform
in
this   -   ArtOrDet
population
will
have
strong
physical
,
psychological
,
social
,
cultural
,
economical
and
cultural
implications
.

such
situation
motivated
the
discovery
of   -   Rloc-
alternative
fuels
that
could
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
imports
.

architectural
design
with
elderly
friendly
considerations
will
be
crucial
so
that
the
chances   have   Vform
of
an
injury
in
their
homes
will
be
kept
to
a
minimal
.

firs   First   Mec
and
foremost
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
bar
code
emerged
and
developed
as
the
times
required

100
international
experts
from
gif
and
other
world
leading
nuclear
power
plant
research
centers
have
gathered
themselves   together   Wci
to
find
the
most
promising
nuclear
systems
.

firstly
,
for   in terms of   Wci
the
cost
factor
,
according
to
michael
(
2009
)
,
he   -   Rloc-
mentioned   -   Rloc-
that   -   Rloc-
uranium   uranium   Mec
,
being
the
raw
resource
of
nuclear
power
plant   -   Rloc-
,
has
been
proved
to
be
able
to
meet
the
need
of
world
demand
for
hundreds
of
centuries
.

firstly
,
the
vhtr
system
can
largely
contribute
to
easing
the
energy
crisis
that
is
widely
spread
all
over
the
world
,
which   -   Rloc-
could   -   Rloc-
save   -   Rloc-
a   -   Rloc-
large   -   Rloc-
amount   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
financial   -   Rloc-
budgets   -   Rloc-
.

otherwise
,
the
degree   Hurricane   Mec
of
destruction
would
be
more
fatal
than
those
mistakes
in
operating
nuclear
power
plants
.

by   by doing   V0
this
,
governments
can
ensure
the
development
of
the   their   Pref
country   countries   Nn
and
provide
a
better
living
environment
and   -   Rloc-
society   -   Rloc-
to
all
the   their   Pref
people
in   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
country   -   Rloc-
.

however
,
there
-   are   V0
bound
to
be
minorities
who
will
think
otherwise
.

the
american
society
of
human
genetics
even
propose
conditions
whereby
patient
autonomy
should
be
disregarded
(
bioethics
advisory
committee,2005
)
,
emphasizing
-   the   ArtOrDet
importance
of
disclosure
of
results
.

after
all
the
research
being   that have been   Vt
done
,
through
software
rendering
and
such
,
the
problems
starts
when
-   one is   Sfrag
trying
to
develop
it
.

in
a
nutshell
,
limiting
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
aged
and
diverting
resources
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
do
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
government
is
neglecting
the
needs
of
the
aged
.

this
gene
when
activated
can
produce
some
types
of
proteins
relating
to
diseases
of
the
aged
(
bbc   result   Vt
news
,
2000
)
.

being
a
firm
believer
of
-   the saying   Others
'prevention
is
better
than
cure
'
,
i
agree
to
a
certain
extent
.

the
information
gathered
enables
one
to
know
how
the
genetic
makeup
of
human
correlate
to
a
particular
cause
of
disease.1
however
the
availability
of
such
test   tests   Nn
has
brought
about
other
ethical
issues
-   ,   Mec
like
,   -   Mec
should
the
results
be
announced
to
the
carrier
of
known
genetic
risk
to
his
relatives
.

a
carrier
could
devise
a
financial
plan
so
that
one
would
-   are   Vform
have
sufficient
monetary
resources
to
support
oneself
even
after
an
early
retirement
.

in
conclusion
,
the
two
main
factors
contributing
to
the
hampering
of
engineering
design
processes
for
innovations
in
singapore
are
caused   -   Rloc-
by   -   Rloc-
singapore
's
small
economic
market
and
its
population
holding
a
resistant   resistance   Wform
to
change
.

for
instance
,
the
chernobyl
accident
is
still
causing
deaths
years
after
the
accident
,
-   with victims   Others
mainly
dying
from
cancer
caused
by
exposure
to
radiation
from
the
highly
radioactive
waste
products
released
after
the
massive
steam
explosion
,
-   which occurred   Others
due
to
system
flaws
,
and
a
second
non-nuclear
explosion
(
international
atomic
energy
agency
,
2006
)
.

also   In addition   Trans
,
``
the
telephone
came
as
a
direct
result
of
his
attempts
to
improve
the
telegraph
.
''

if
a
country
neglects
other
aspects
such
as
education
and
infrastructure
development
,
but
overly   over focuses   SVA
focus   over focuses   SVA
on
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
its
economy
will
suffer
drastically
.

then
i
-   also   Others
tell
something
about
how
the
technological
inventions
help
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

secondly
,
automation
helps
to
solve   reduce   Wci
the
social
cost
and
reduces
the
need
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
younger
generation
to
take
care
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
population
.

this
reminds
policymakers
to
adopt
a
more
caution   cautious   Wform
mindset
while
allocating
fund   funds   Nn
to
public
spending
.

also
,
individual   individuaindividuals   Nn
have
to
keep
fit
to
reduce
the
probability
of
getting
ill
in
order
to
avoid
expensive
medical
bill   bills   Nn
at   during   Prep
older
age
.

this
is
because
the
elderly
has   have   SVA
not
only
contributed
significantly
to
the
society
;   ,   Mec
in   but in fact   Trans
fact   but in fact   Trans
they   but in fact   Trans
have
many
important
roles
to
play
.

as
a
most
important
aspect
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
science
and
technology
of
the
nation
as
well
as
improve
-   the   ArtOrDet
living
standard
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
people
,
engineering
design
for
innovations
plays
a
significant
role
in
the
current
chinese
society
.

according
to
the
design
process
,
the
second
step
is
to
gather
related
information
,
then
generate
various   possible   Wci
solutions
.

helen
keller
made
her
miraculous
breakthrough   in the fact that   Ssub
as
she
spelled
w-a-t-e-r
when

ran
over
her

.

besides
the
company
's
perceptions
,
economic
factor   -   Nn
also
play
an
important
role
.

with
little
economic
growth
,
-   a   ArtOrDet
society
may
be
faced
with
fewer
options
on
how
to
take
care
of
people
who
are
least
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
.

finally   Thus   Trans
,
the
famous
warfarin
came
into
use
!

showed
that
when

such
as

,
they
interfered

the
devices
in
34
tests

of
all
123

.

in
the
same
time
,

united

also
implemented
the
usage   use   Vform
of

.

nuclear

is
now
widely
used
in
many
countries
and
plays
a
more
and
more
important
role
in
the
21th
century
.

if
this
maintains   trend continues   Others
,
by
2030
,
the   -   Rloc-
ratio   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-

therefore
,
the
abovementioned
policies
will
not
be
as
effective
as
when
it   they are   Pform
is   they are   Pform
implemented
on
its   their   Pform
own
;
it   They   Pform
needs
to
supplement
each
other
for
it
to
work
.

however
,
there
have
been
laws
set
up
to
prevent
discrimination
against
individuals
who
are   suffer   Vt
suffering   suffer   Vt
from
genetic
diseases
.

indeed
just
earlier
this
year
,
a
team
of
national
university
of
singapore
researchers
find   found   Vt
themselves
facing
this
problem
.

these
policies
would
eventually
apply
to
all
individual   individuals   Nn
as
aging
is
part
of
a   the   ArtOrDet
human
cycle
.

people
may
think
about
what
led
-   to   Prep
the
success
of
the
discovery
of
magnetic
monopole   monopoles   Nn
.

in
addition
,
helium
is
not
the
only
coolant
that
is
chemically
inert
with
the
fuel
;
molten
lead
is
another
viable
option
and
yet   is   Wci
plentiful
in   on   Prep
the
earth
's
crust
.

singapore
makes
it
her
top
priority
to
create
a
safer   to achieve   Wci
environment   to achieve   Wci
for
the
elderly
to
live
in
.

the
reason
is
that
not
everyone
is
willing
to
have
a
baby
just
to
get
the
benefit
from   offered by   Wci
the
scheme
.

generally
,
most
of
the
technological
innovations
are
created
through
basic
research
,
followed
by
applied
research
and
finally
leading
to
development
.

however
,
little
did
they
-   :   Mec
know
that
medisave
account
might
be
exhausted
after
a
week
.

for
example
,
in
singapore
,
one
room
apartment
with
specially
installed
emergency
buttons
and
lifts
are   is   ArtOrDet
catered
to
the
elderly
.

in
other
words
,
apple
had
given
away
their
private
tools
to
build
-   the   ArtOrDet
an
application
in
order
to
develop
their
products
.

since   In   Wci
the
past
decade
,
people
are   have been   Vt
getting   becoming   Wci
more
conscious
of
the
damages   damage   Nn
that
we
have
been
inflicting
to   on   Prep
the
earth   earth   Mec
.

overall
saying   -   Rloc-
,
the
productively   productivity   Wform
level
in
china
is
not
high
,
and
the
socialist
market
economy
has
established
initially
.

thus   This   ArtOrDet
proving   proves   Vt
to
be
a
better
solution
to   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
problem   -   Rloc-
,   because it allows   Srun
allowing   because it allows   Srun
the
government
to
limit
the
public
spending
and
allow   -   Rloc-
fellow
citizens
to
take
responsibility
.

these
problems
in
academic
circle
are
-   the   ArtOrDet
impeding
engineering
design
.

without
funding
,
this
step
of
designing
would
be
impossible
especially
if
the
raw
materials
are
required
in
large
quantity   quantities   Nn
.

furthermore
,
terrorist
attacks
could
also
come
in
many
other
forms
;
one
well-known
example
is
the
terrorist
attack
upon
the
united
stated   States   Mec
on
11
september
2001
which
does   did   Vt
not
involve
nuclear
reactors
.

talking   When talking   Others
about
the
most
serious
accident
ever
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear
power
history
,
the
1986
chernobyl
accident
will
come
to
everyone
's
mind
(
unscear
,
2009
)
.

for
instance
,
in
designing
a
car
,
internal
combustion
engine   engines   Nn
are
specifically
configured
to
work
optimally
and
therefore
the
design
of
components
such
as
cooling
system
and
piston
engine
valves
should
be
taken
into
consideration
.

actually
,
according
-   to   Others
the
report
from
discovery
:
vhtr
plants
could
even
produce
hydrogen
for
fuel
using
high-temperature
steam
electrolysis
,
which
breaks
apart
the
bonds
of
water

the   -   ArtOrDet

how
it
is

and
in

and
government
's
policies
can
help
to
alleviate
these
problems
.

they
are
all
feeble
and
vulnerable
people
.

one
example
is
the
very-high-temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
which
can
produce
hydrogen
fuel
and
-   which   Spar
can
be
first   completed   Wci

(
the
earliest

.

although
many
believe
that
admitting
to
a
disorder
will
give
rise
to
discrimination
and
strained
relationship
,
they
-   the   ArtOrDet
failed
to
consider
that
relatives
appreciate
the
trust
.

similarly
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
serendipitous   serendipity   Wform
is
the
effect
by
which
one
accidentally
discovers
something
fortunate
,
especially
while
looking
for
something
entirely
different
.

in
this
way
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
standard
and
quality

are   has   Vt
improved

a

degree

this
innovation
make   has helped   Wci
sharp   Sharp   Mec
-   to   Wci
achieve
a   -   ArtOrDet
great
success
.

but
there
is
no
doubt
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
because
it
affects
the
level
of
fund   funds   Nn
being
diverted
to
areas
that

of
a
country
,   . However ,   Srun
however   . However ,   Srun
more
importantly
,
it
is
the
level
of
limitation
that
a
country
has
to
take
note
of
.

the
second
problem
that
hinders
engineering
design
processes
for
innovations
is
that
we   -   Wtone
,   -   Wtone
singaporeans
,
are
not
as

instead

the

thus

the

although   However , although   Trans

future

when

the

singapore
's
emphasis

firstly
,
the

the

critics

there

no

the

step
is
to

although
the
help
is
theoretically
superficial

it
is
indirectly
helping
the
society
to

society
more
effectively
than   as compared to   ArtOrDet
using
the   -   ArtOrDet
monetary

which
is
a
temporary
solution

from
other   another   Wci
perspective
,
an
increase
in
the
aging
population
will
lead
to
an
increase
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
government
spending
on
the
elderly
.

nowadays   Currently   Wci
,
there
are
around
440
nuclear

reactors
generating
one-sixth
of
the
electricity
of
the

with
huge
families
facing

,
the
government
will
have
to
stand
him   in   Wci
to
provide
for

however
the

of

simply
could
not
bypass   overtake   Wci
the
sales
of
other
imported
cars
such

in
this
way
,
public
spending
will
not
be
misused
,   and   Trans
children
are
forced
to
be
filial
and
therefore
,
-   the government   Pform
do
not
have
to
set
a
limitation
on
public
spending
since
the
amount
spent
on
the
aged
will
be
lesser
.

the

however
,
i
do
not
agree
that

labour

problem   -   Rloc-
that
the
demographic
aging
issue
brings
about
based
on
the
context
of

.

a
journal

had
cited

they
will
tend
to
feel
disappointed
because
they
need
to
solicit
a
lot
of
funds
,
putting
in
their
utmost
efforts
when
developing
the
products
,
and   but   Trans
only
to
find
out
that

face
rejection
by

the
creation

the

normally

mnay   Many   Mec
people
might
however
,
disagree
that

should
limit
the
public

on

moreover
,

thus
,
this
information
can
help
them
in
making
informed
choices
about
their

from
the

we

that

this
over   -   Prep
,
however
,
has
been
taken
too
seriously
by
some
countries
.

since
today

is
15

and
is
estimated
to
grow
phenomenally

by

2030
(
centre
for

)
,
thus   -   Trans
,   -   Trans
governments
are
deeply
concerned
with
the
implementation
of
fiscal
and
welfare
policies
that
would
directly
impact
the
aged
.

without
setting
a
limit
on
the
government
funds
spent
on   toll   Wci
the

,
all
these
will
not
be
possible

to

and

for

.

there
is
another
reason
why
public
funding
on
the
elderly
should
be
limited
.

with
the
advance   the advancement of   Wci
medical
technologies
,
illnesses
such
as
cardiovascular
and
cataract
diseases
have
lesser

what
is

a

which
all
are
considered
as   to be   Wci
important
factors

alleviating
the
aging
process
.

it
is
also
not
necessary
that
elderly
will
claim
more
money
on
medical
since
chronic
diseases
attack
humans
without
the
age
barrier
.

however
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
chinese
people
did
not
give
up
;
chinese
leaders
put
forward
a
series
of
policies
.

in
time
to
come
,
the
young
can
give
back
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
society
unlike
the

.

many
different
countries
had   have   Vt
come
out   up   Wci
with
many
different
innovative
designs
to
facilitate
the
objective
.

therefore
,
funds
should
be
limited

in
the
area
of
spending
on
the
aged
.

however
,
by   this   ArtOrDet

so   this   ArtOrDet
will
have
a

according

due   due   Mec
to

clearly
,
many
problems
associating

still
persist

in

many
socio

hence
,
recent
technological

such
as
assistive
technologies
for

or

can
in

ease
the

making

supposing   Suppose   Vform
an
engineering

group
is
working

that
should

not   The government should   Sfrag
try
to
accommodate
the

while
limiting
public
spending
on

.

however
,
the
federal

has
implemented
the
genetic

act
to
prevent

from
being
discriminated
by
the
insurance
company

(

hence
the

the
growth
of

's
important
developments
,
and
one
of
which
is
the
economy
of
the
country
.

in
the
past
before
the
discovery
of
the
space
pen
,
astronauts
had
difficulty
in
writing
their
discoveries
with   :   Mec
the
normal
pens
as
they
resulted
in
leaks
in
zero
gravity
space
.

as
the
economic   economy   Wform
develops
,
the
country
will
generate
more
money
and
thus
be
able
to
spend
a
greater
amount
of
money
on
programs
such
as
health
care
support
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
.

however
,
according
to
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
published
by
the
national
cancer
institute
,
a
major
survey
showed
that
there

even
if
there

fuel
,
they
would
suppress   resist to develop   Wci
it
at   -   Rloc-

these
two
factors-   factors --   Mec
one

to

and
one

to

be
eliminated
by
carefully
using
psychology
in

design
process

-   The   ArtOrDet

the   -   ArtOrDet
former   -   ArtOrDet

a

furthermore
,
compare   compared   Vform
to

and
nature   natural   Wform

which

nuclear

is
much
more
environmental

.

expediting
the
cracking
of   as   Wci
criminal   as   Wci
cases
is
another
point
to
why
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
banned
.

for
example
,
one
of
the
reasons
why
-   the   ArtOrDet
refrigerator
was
not
widely
used
by
common   many common households   ArtOrDet
household   many common households   ArtOrDet
before
1930s
is
because
the
refrigerator
at
that
time
was
using
toxic-gas   a toxic gas   ArtOrDet
system
,
which
would
destroy
the
environment
and
be
unsafe
for
home
use
.

it
is
controversial
since
many
people
are
afraid
that
spending
too
much
money
on
the
elderly
might
decrease
national
budgets
for
other
areas
'   -   Rloc-
-   of   Wci
development
.

without
any
doubt
,
it
is   will be   Vt
common
to
see
an
increasing   increase   Wform
in
the

population
.

thus

the

applies

in

the

there

therefore

rather

we

to

the

the

this

civics
and
moral
education
.

in
these
recent
years
,
the
entire
world
has
been
confronted
with
a
severe
economic
recession
;
which
is
believed
to
not
only
negatively
affects   affect   Vt
lives
of
millions
of
people
in
both
developing
and
developed
countries
but
also
seriously
threatens   threaten   Vt
the
development
of
numerous
firms
and
companies
from
almost
every
sector
of
the
economy
.

in
case
the
test
results
are
positive   possible   Wform
,
they
will
be
able
to
receive
medical
treatment
to
reduce
risk
.

since
genetic
testing
may
open
up
ethical
or
psychological
problems
,
carriers
of
a
known
genetic
risk
should
be
obligated
to
reveal
the   certain   ArtOrDet
results
to
their
relatives
.

the
aged
might
have
devoted
their
youth
and
even
their
whole
life
to
serving
the
society
,   ; and   Srun
public
spending
on
the
aged
is
therefore
necessary
.

if
the
highest
levels
of
nasa
had
made
the
decision
more
objectively
and
scientifically
-   a   ArtOrDet
with
the
help
of
psychology
in
design
,
putting
the
mission
off
like
before
,
the
disaster
could
have
been
prevented
.

with
these
improvements
,
we
are
one
step
closer
in
building
a
totally
barrier-free
healthy
environment
where
the
elderly
can
travel
around
freely
and
safely
in
absolute
comforts   comfort   Rloc-
.

besides
this
,
the
mining
cost
of
uranium   uranium   Spar
is
also
very
cheap
.

shrinking   A shrinking   ArtOrDet
workforce
is
another
problem
arising
from
an
aging
population
.

in
addition
,
some
of
those
cost   expenses   Wci
on   incurred to support   Others
the
elderly
will
end
up
getting
shifted
back
to
the
public
sector
through
less
direct
and
more
expensive
means
.

preventive
measures
can
be
taken
by
referencing
medical
brochures/guides
,
or
consulting
the
doctor
on
the
suitable
type
of
supplements   old..   Mec

if
one
has

history
.

but
recently
,
vast
amount   amounts   Nn
of
supporters
-   have   Vt
surfaced
,
mainly
due
to
the
urgent
need
in
reducing
carbon

emissions
.

the

among

the

which
is
based
on
the   -   ArtOrDet
economics   economic   Wform
,
safety
and
sustainability
factors
(
cogeneration
technologies
,
2003
)
.

although
an
aging
population
is
a
global
phenomenon
,
public
spending
should   channeled   Wtone
also
be
allocated
in
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
such
as
tourism
or
housing
to
help
increase
economic
growth
,
to
make
singapore
a
global
city
.

among
these
issues
,
two
will
be
discussed
here
,   .   Mec
both   Both   Mec
support
the
fact
that
surveillance
technology
creates
risk
to
privacy
that
far
outweighs
the
technology
's
heralded
benefits   .   Mec
and   -   Rloc-
thus   Thus   Mec
the
usage
of
such
technology
in
tracking
people
should
be
banned
.

without
the
guarantee
of
healthy
economy
,
the
government
can
not
improve
or
develop
any
necessary
areas
in
their
country   budget   Nn
.

for
example
,
the
installation
of

bars
around

can
help
to

some
people
still
doubt
the   -   Rloc-
safety
of
scwr
's
design
;
in
their
opinion
,
a
simple
design
may
lack

that
cause

.

-   The   ArtOrDet
singapore

had   has   Vt
been

should
greater
consideration

(
and
potential
safety
)
when
the
reactor
core
is
not

functioning
as

,
it
can
be
argued
that
the
problem
would
have
been
identified
by
then
,
and
a
meltdown
would
not
have
occurred
then
.

moreover
,
at

,
there
are
still
many

multiple
factors

and

.

first
,
for
the
sodium-cooled
fast   -   ArtOrDet
reactor
,
it
is
top-ranked
in
sustainability
because
of
its
closed
fuel
cycle
and
excellent
potential
for
actinide
management
.

we   They   Pref
also
need
to
consider
the
commercialization
of

.

this
would
not
have   ,   Mec
happen
if
there
have
been
funding
for
research
and
development
to
produce
a
cheaper
reactor
.

(

2007
)
.under   . Under   Mec
this
scenario
,
molten
salt
reactors
(
msrs
)
are
the
best
options
for
three
reasons
.

secondly
,
with
lesser
money
spent
on
the
aged   dependent   Wform
,
the
government
can
improve
the
education
system
in
singapore
for
the
younger
generation
.

however
,
these
arguments
put
forth
in
support
of
not
informing

are
faulty
.

therefore

it

be

to

throughout
human
history   times   Nn
,   times   Nn
people
have
conceived
of
many
ways
to
get
rid
of
heat
in
hot

.

countries
going
through
industrialization
will
also   is   SVA
benefit
from
the

.

therefore
,
as
this
phenomenon
poses
a
certain
threat
to
the
development   increased   Vform
of
a
country
,
many
governments
have
produced
policies
and
initiatives
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

if
we
do
not
limit
the
spending
on
the
aged
,
singapore
may
risk
the   -   Wci
possibility   -   Wci
of   -   Wci

what
will

subsidies
on

at

and

for
the

for

will
be
cut
off
-   ,   Mec
hence
leaving
them   the elderly   Pref
to
be   fend for themselves   Others
self-supporting   fend for themselves   Others
.

it
should
be
evident
that
none
of
the
opposing
statement   statements   Nn
is
valid
for
sfr
.

nuclear
reactors
would
then
become
less
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
terrorist
target
.

the
elderly
once   were once   WOadv
were   were once   WOadv
hard
working
not
only
in
raising
-   their   Others
children
but
also
in
devoting
their
strength
,   and   Others
intelligence
for
a
better
society
like
-   the one we have   Spar
today
.

however
,
this
claim
only
takes
into
consideration
the
operation
cost
in
the
long
run
and
does
not
take
into
account
for   -   Prep
the
high
set
up
cost
estimated
in
2009
to
be
around
10
billion
dollars
for
just
one
reactor
(
travis
,
johanna
,
&
emily
,
2009
)
.

hence
,
help
is
heavily
needed
from
the
government
to
keep
the
poor
aged
to   alive   Wci
survive   alive   Wci
.

the
manpower   human   Wci
resources
of
many
developed
countries
are
predicted
to
shrink
as
a
hefty
portion
of
the
workforce
is
edging
towards
retirement
.

therefore
,
rfid
should
be
banned
as
the
device   technology   Wci
is
flawed
.

in
fact
,
counsellors
have
observed
an
increasing
trend
of
the
-   a   ArtOrDet
elderly
living
alone
or
being
left
under
the
care
of
charities
or
old
folks
'
homes
by
their
families
(
the
new
paper
,
2009
)
.

therefore
the
risk
gene
carrier
should
be
obliged
to
tell
the
family
members
if
he
or
she
has
-   a   ArtOrDet
genetic
risk
within   -   Rloc-
them   -   Rloc-
.

thus
,
when
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
discloses
the
results
with
his
or
her
relatives
,
more
people
will
be
able
to
take   their   Pref
precautionary
measures
if
tested
positive
.

for
example
in
singapore
,
the
government
has
implemented
the
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
life
scheme
-   's   Wform
that
will
provide
lifelong
income
for
the
elderly
in
their
retirement
.

one
example
is
the   has   Vt
pebble
bed
reactor
,
an
innovative
design
that
is
being
actively
researched
in
china
.

while
someone
may
argues   argue   SVA
that
financial
support
to
the

offered
by
a
government
should
be
increased
regardless
of

objectives
with   -   Um

so   -   Um

in   -   Um

they
also
have
to
face
the
fact
that
they
are
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
workload
they
used
to
handle
in
the   their   Npos
young   younger   Wform

days
even
if
they
wanted   want   Vt
to

when
rfid
and
other
surveillance
technology   technologies   Nn
are
used
to
track
children
-   's   Npos
movement
,
we
are
not
only
invading
the
children
-   's   Npos
privacy
but
also
undermining
their
dignity
(
anonymous
2005
)
.

in
the
near
future
,
a
couple
has
to
support
four
parents
.

the
benefits
of
rfid
are
its
efficiency
and
the
safety
it
can
offer
which
people
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
future
will
enjoy
.

to
begin
with
,
it
is
no
doubt
that
when
a
person
becomes
older
,
he
will
meet   experience   Wci
health
problems
,
physically
and
mentally
.

although
many
has   have   SVA
debated
that
this
is
discrimination
as
companies
may
not
employ
those
who
has   have   SVA
inherited
disease   diseases   Nn
,
but
companies
do
have
the
right
to
choose
employer   employees   Wci
with
concern
to   for   Prep
their
profits
and
the
safety
of
others
.

also   -   Trans
,   -   Trans
especially   Especially   Mec
in
asian
societies
,
such
as
singapore
,
older
people
are
traditionally
supported
by
their
own
families
.

when
the   -   ArtOrDet
education
is
enhanced
,
graduates
would   -   Vm
have
a
higher
chance
of
getting
a
job
and
hence
contributing
to
the
economic
development
of
the
country
.

the
first
limit   limitation   Wform
for
the
development
of
hawk-eye
is
its
high
cost
.

this
is
evident
by
the   an   ArtOrDet
increasingly   increasing   Wform
number
of
old
people
being
send   sent   Vform
to
old
folks
home
every
year
.

but
the
illiterate
will
not
stay
illiterate
always
,   ;   Srun
if
they
put
an
effort
to
improve
and
are
given
a
chance
for
good
education
,
they
can
still
develop
into
a
group
of
productive
singaporeans
.

therefore
,
if
the
government
does
not
limit
the
spending
,
more
taxpayer
's
money
will
be
needed
to
be   -   Rloc-
spend   -   Rloc-
to   -   Rloc-
care
for
the
elderly
.

governments
of
many
countries   helped   Vform
have
come
up
with
policies
and
solutions
to
decrease
elder
dependency
and
slowing
down
the
process
of
a
fast
aging
population
.

through
research
,
psychologists
found
out
that
elderly
-   people   Wci
gets
depress
easily
.

gradually
,
people
's
life
may
be
destroyed
by
psychological
and
mental
problems   upon   Prep
.

however
welfare
for
the
elderly
should
be
offered
on
varying
levels
with
accordance
to
individual
elderly   -   Rloc-
needs
,
in
order
to
better
allocate
a
country
's
limited
resources
and
eliminate
inefficiency
and
wastage
(

knowing
of

allows
the

to
make

whether

whether

because
there

the

however

even

giving

it

let
us
look
at
the
example
from
america
,
denmark
and
holland
.

in
an
article
in

reuters

it
is
indeed
believed

imaging   Imagine   Others
how
much
it
costs
if
the
battery
charging

are
built
in
every

.

personally
,
i
do   many   Wtone
agree
that
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
more
money
can
be
channelled
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

in
addition
,
the
international
atomic

agency
(

)
has
set
up
necessary
guidelines
for
the   -   ArtOrDet
governments

certain

thus   so   Trans

the

are
against

more

due

this
results

throughout   -   Rloc-

designing   Because designing   Ssub
a

great

but   -   Rloc-
those
nuclear

are
still

the
policy
,
however
,
has
its

hinders   hindrances   Wform
.

leaders

should
balance
the

potential

up
less

than

and
(

(

.

in
my
opinion
,
the
elderly
does   do   SVA
not
need
to
worry
about
getting
good
healthcare
services
as
it
is
easily
found
anywhere

secondly
,
money
can
be
diverted
to

in

of
increasing
the

for

these

as

it
is
even   -   Rloc-

in

,
since
most
people
recognize
the

of   -   Rloc-
surveillance   -   Rloc-
technology
,
such
technology
should
not
be
banned
even
if
it

the

is
growing
at
a
considerably
faster
rate
than
the

however
,
this
public

should
not

at

of

that
concern   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-

as

as

as
the

grows
,
these   -   ArtOrDet

should
increase
proportionately
with   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
size   -   Rloc-
to
ensure
that
the

the

the

therefore
,
it
can
be

that
the

affected

in

it

,

the

therefore

in

besides

most
significantly

it

furthermore

is   are   SVA
inherently
embedded
in

,
ensuring

high

.

as
the
first
step
of

,
the

of

is
significantly
considered
in
both   two ways   Wci
two   two ways   Wci
types   two ways   Wci
.

therefore
,
the
vhtr
model
should
be
given
more
funding
for
further
research
and
development
.

before
that   ,   Mec
the
use
of

was
very
limited
as
the
battery
technology
is   was   Vt
not
available
or
too   was   V0
costly   was   V0
.

old
people
tend
to
have
little
or
no

.

these
nuclear
reactors
-   ,   Mec
unlike
the
conventional
power
plants
,
they   -   Rloc-
do
not
produce
greenhouse

(

.

then   Therefore ,   Trans

treated

it   -   Sfrag
was   -   Sfrag

thus
,
we
should
solve
the
problem
we
are
facing
now
,
rather
than
allocating   allocate   Vt
resources
in   to   Trans
other
areas
.

people
often
think
of
privacy
as
some
kind
of
right
.

for
example
,
although
the
start-up
cost
of
building
the
vhtr
plant
is
very
high
,
which
is
up
to
us
$
10

to   -   Rloc-

,
it
is
cheaper
as
compared
to
other
fuel
,
such
as
bio

,
in
the
long
run
.

moreover
,
one
will
become
physically
weak
as
one
aged   ages   Wform
and
this
will
lead
a
higher
tendency
to
cause
a

oneself
.

the

.

finally
,
given
that
people
are
worried
about
the   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear
power
,
it
is
much
needed
that
we
should
research
on
it
so
that
it
will
be
safer
and
more
efficient
for
us
.

another

acknowledge
that

hence

there

thus

nonetheless
,
debate
on
the
using
of
this
nuclear

becomes   has become   Vt
a
hot
issue
today
due
to
the
negative
effects
that
would
be
brought
to

the
best
alternative
is
therefore
to
make
a

investment
by
limiting
the
spending
on
the
aged
and
diverts   divert   Vt
the
budget
to
other
areas
of

.

substantial
knowledge
of
the
product
and
its
users
will
allow
engineers
to
make
an
accurate
evaluation
which
involves
rating
-   safety   Others
factors
and
value
factors
.

such
measures
of
saving
for
the
raining   rainy   Wform
days
will
help
singaporeans
to
cover
part
of
their
medical
expenses
as
they
retire
into
old
age
.

first
of
all
,
the
use
of
psychology
in
the
design
process
could
have
prevented
the
accident
by
realizing
the
need
of
adding
several
failure
detection
systems   a lack   Mec
on
the
train
.

nevertheless
,
conventional
r
&
d
organizations
can
generate
innovations
stably
and
continuously
,
which   were   Vt
is
still
essential
to
the
development
of
the
company
.

government   The government   ArtOrDet
should
spend
more
on
transportation
by
providing
more
facilities
for
the
disable   disabled   Wform
and
poor
.

as
the
employers
do
not
show
much
respect
to
normal
employees
,
few
employees
will
try
their
best
to
provide
their
experience
to
research
staffs   staff   Nn
.

nevertheless
,
there
are
policies
that
allow
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
to
monetize
their
housing
assets
.

moreover
,
the
performance
of   compared   Wform
a
nuclear

is
very
significant
compared
to
conventional
thermal
power
station
.

by   After   Wci
identifying
the
problem
and
listing
all
the
possible
resolutions   solutions   Wci
,
it
will
figure
out
the
best
energy

try
to
utilize
it
to

energy
.

the

focus

china
is   allocated   Wci
the
efficiency

.

hence
,
with
the

advantages

surveillance

so
besides

in

because

in

however

with

in

this

can
be

by
considering
different
types
of
method   methods   Nn
to

it

to

one   among   Wci

besides

that

as
it

because
many
vehicles
travel
at
much
higher
speed
especially
in
highways
(

.

secondly
,
it
can
reduce   in   Prep
the
possibility
of
errors
which
may
happen
in
the
process
.

adherents
who
starkly
believe
that
public

should
be
focused
on
the
aged
often
claim
that

elderly
people
are
not
financially
protected
once
they

retired
from
their

.

from

that

another
way
to
carry
out
this
strategy
is
that
the
budget
can
be
used
to
promote   of   Prep
and
export
the

in

,
because
of

economic

,
ensuring
better
lives
for

generation   generations   Nn
of

people
and
stressing

,
limiting
public
spending
on
the
aged
in
order
to
invest
in
other
prior   -   Um
areas
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
country
's
development
is
a
good
approach
to
solve
-   the   ArtOrDet
global
aging
problem
.

in
contrast
,
public
spending
for   for the   Others
the

is
limited
in
singapore
.

whereas
advocates
of
such
surveillance
technologies
emphasize
on
the
benefit   benefits   Pref
-   such   Wci
as
to
promote
work
efficiency
and
secure
communal

,
opponents
strike
back
by
stating
intensified
concerns
related
to
individual
privacy
.

one
of
which
is
immigration
approach   -   Rloc-
,
which
have   has   SVA
attracted
many
immigrants
mainly
from
china
,
india

and
malaysia
to
integrate
into
our   -   Wtone
society
and
their   -   Rloc-

have   has   SVA
helped

eventually   -   Rloc-

the

launched
the

,
which
can
provide
much
better
quality

so
if
the
solution
is
not
the
standard
solution
which
is
given
by
-   the   ArtOrDet
ministry
of
education
,
the
solution
is
incorrect
.

this
may
again
increase
the
amount
of
public
spending
to   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
spent   -   Rloc-
on
the

.

in
addition
,
it
is
essential
to
increase
public
awareness
through
campaigns
and
seminars
to
allow   give   Wci
-   the   ArtOrDet
public
to   -   Rloc-
have   -   Rloc-
a
better
understanding
on

.

in
such
-   a   ArtOrDet
situation
,
the
appearance
of
nuclear
energy
becomes
so
important
,
for
the
nuclear
power
has
great
advantages
over
other   many   Wci
conventional
energies
.

in
conclusion
,
this
article   essay   Wci
has
illustrated
that
the
current
policies
in
singapore
have
helped
ease
the
ageing
process
to
a
large
extent
.

the
limit
,
however
,
should
be
duly
considered
by
the
government
in
line
with
its   introducing   ArtOrDet
current
policies
.

an

if

the

2009

according
to
world-nuclear
(
2009
)
,
the
explosion
happened
during
a
test
on
how
long
the
turbines
would   -   Nn
spin
and
supply
power
with
the
main
power
supply
cut
off
.

although
some
argue
that
genetic
testing
raises
social
issue   issues   Nn
,
these
individuals
may
face
discrimination
from
employers
,
insurance
providers
and
society
.

there
is
a
need
to   for   Wci
have   for   Wci
an
attitude
change
in
both
the
government
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
society
.

nowadays
in
this
high
pacing   emergence   Wform
society
,
everything
is
required
to
be
precise
.

furthermore
,
the
improvement   improvements   Nn
of   in the   Wci
healthcare
system
is
also
lightening
the
aging
burden
.

the   -   ArtOrDet
vhtr
produces
``
less
heavy
metal
radioactive
waste
''
and
``
less
plutonium
per
unit
of
energy
produced
''
because
of
the
vhtr
's
high
thermal
efficiency
(
shropshire
and
herring
,
2004
)
.it
has
a
high
thermal
efficiency
of
over
50
%
,
while
other
reactors
only
have
a
thermal
efficiency
of
33
%
-50
%
(
u.s.
doe
nuclear
energy
research
advisory
committee
,
2009
)
.thus
,
the
vhtr
is
less
harmful
to
the
environment
.

second
,
the
usage
of
rfid
by
company
to   companies   Nn
track
other
company
's
data
,
such
that
all
fax
,
telephone
,
or
email
are
intercepted
so
that
all
of
the
vital
and
very
useful
data
of
one
company
can
be
detected
by
other
company
(
bogonikolos,1999
)
.

a
very
good
example
will   is   Vt
be   is   Vt
japan
.

the
first
example
is
the   urgent   Wci
engineer
of
toshiba
who
wanted
to
create
a
laptop
(
pp.144-
146
rogers
,
(
2003
)
)
.

socially
,
we
have
been
conditioned
to
believe
that
the
innovation
is
the
inevitable
product
of
market
competition
and
engineering
advancement
,   whom   Pref
not
a
product
of
compromise
and
negotiation
.

this
writer
feels
that
the
introduction
of
a
psychologist
in
a
team
of
design
engineers
would
not
have   -   Rloc-
prevented
the
accident
.

in
singapore
,
moving
on
to
the
commercialization
stage
of
the
design
process
is
not
easily
achieved
without
going
through
tough
brain   brainstorming   Mec
storming   brainstorming   Mec
.

however
,
this
scheme
did   has not worked   Vt
not   has not worked   Vt
work   has not worked   Vt
as
well
as
predicted
even
though
the
government
has
put
efforts
in   into   Prep
promoting
it
.

in
singapore
,
there
are
``
-   some help   Wci
over
300
existing
voluntary
welfare
organizations
and
service
providers
''
and
recently
,
the
centre
for
enabled
living
(
cel
)
,
with
effort
from
the
government
,
was
launched
to
provide
a
first-stop
referral
service
to
the
existing
welfare
organisations
.

there
are
two
main
benefits
that
the
use
of
surveillance
technology
has
brought
to   -   Rloc-
.

the
government
should
not
hesitate
to
spend   invest in   Wci
on   invest in   Wci
the
latest
military
technology
and
equipment
.

secondly
,
many
countries
have
adopt   adopted   Vform
effective
strategies
to
make
the
effect   expenditure on health for an aging population   WOinc

to   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
small
and
manageable
,
here
is   are   SVA
some
of
the
strategies
:
(

)
stratify
the
old
by
age
and
sex
;
(

)
give   -   Um
the   -   Um
limited   -   Um

;
(

)
increase
transparency
about
self-employed
income
to
ensure
fairness
in
the
financing
of
social
insurance
systems
,
including
the
new
long-term
care
insurance
.

therefore
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
process
can
be
eased
by
helping
the
elderly
develop
a
positive
attitude
towards
life
.

besides
that
,
the
elderly
were
once
the
people
who
had   -   Vt
contributed
to
the
growth
of
the
nation
and
economy
.

it   This   ArtOrDet
is
a

and
always   thus   Wci

furthermore
,

moreover

with
public
spending
reduced
in
areas
such
as
education
and
housing
so
as
to
fund
the

,
the
country

be

lack

as

however
,
the
challenge   challenges   Nn
lies   lie   SVA
between   in   Prep
the
complication

fission
reactor
and
short   the lack   Wci
of

to

out
researches   research   Nn
on   in   Prep
this
area
.

first
of
all
,
large
spending
on
the
aged
results
in
an
imbalance
of
governments
'
expenditure
.

between
the
two
significant
contributing
factors
to
this
phenomenon
,
declining   ; thus ,   Srun
fertility   ; thus ,   Srun
is
likely
to
hold
primary
responsibility
for
the
aging

population

this
could
be
treated
via
injection
of
recombinant
factor
viii
concentrate
into
the
veins
within
an
hour
when
excessive
bleeding
starts
.

as
mentioned
in
the
previous
paragraph
,
the
surveillance
camera
could
enable
the
police
to
identify
the
terrorists
easily
after
the
attack

them   reducing   Vform
.   reducing   Vform

in
the
past
years
,
accidents

.

as
-   can be   Trans
seen
,
the
cpf
policy
had   has   Vt
not
only
help
the
aged
to
cope
with
monetary
issues
after
retirement

making
sure

it
certain
that
the   they   Mec

healthcare

since
electric
vehicles
are   were   Vt
very
light
,
they
may   could   Vm
be
quite
fragile
when   if   Trans
they
are   were   Vt
hit
by
heavy
vehicles
.

the
monitoring
of
one
's
movements
and
activities
is   has been   Vt
introduced
to
ensure
our
safety
and
prevent
crimes
.

accelerated
development
of
msrs
will
result
in
the
us
to   -   Rloc-
successfully
tackle   managing   Vform
-   the   ArtOrDet
nuclear
waste
problem
and
revolutionize   revolutionizing   Spar
an
entire
new
level
of
carbon-free
energy
that
can
last
longer
than
just
centuries
.

anyway
,
all
the
efforts
done   made   Wci
by
the
investigator
and
engineers
are
to
make
the
nuclear
power
plants
much
safer
and
-   the resultant measures   Wci
can
be
more
widely
used
to
meet
the
great
demand
of
energy
today
.

the
elderly
usually
do
not
have
enough
strength
to
do
manual
labor
whereas
mental
work
requires
perspicacity
and
concentration
that   , areas in which   WOinc
they
can
not
compete
with
other   -   Rloc-
potential   -   Rloc-
young   younger   Wform
candidates
.

there
are
also
worries
about
the
elderly   health status of the elderly workers   Npos
workers   health status of the elderly workers   Npos
'   health status of the elderly workers   Npos
health   health status of the elderly workers   Npos

in
fact
,
some
fast
food
restaurants
have
actively
recruited
the
elderly
because
many
are
just
as
reliable
and
hardworking
and   -   Rloc-
sometimes   -   Rloc-
more   -   Rloc-
loyal   -   Rloc-
as
their
younger
counter-parts
.

the
government
would
get
involved
once
again
and   to   Wci
provide
subsidies
for
the
elderly
in
medical
bills
and
as   so on   Wci
such   so on   Wci
.

besides
that
,
the
development
of
the
electric
car
industry
will
definitely
affect
traditional
gasoline
car
industry   industries   Nn
.   industries   Nn

thus
,
public
spending
-   has   Vt
always
included
the   -   ArtOrDet
spending
on
elderly
.

in
order
to
let
the
aged
enjoy
a
relatively
good
life
,
the
governments
grant
pension
and
other   of   Prep
benefits
for
the
old
.

furthermore
,
comparing
the
generation-iv
reactors
with
older
nuclear
reactors
,
the
new
reactors
are
much
more
efficient
,   . Some   Srun

of
them

like
the

.

alternatively   The   WOadv
,   The   WOadv
the   The   WOadv
nobel
peace
prize
laureate
,
mohamed
elbaradei
,
proposed
that
these
countries
could
-   alternatively   WOadv
construct
hundreds
of
small-scale
plants
for
a
single
town
;   ,   Sfrag
each

using
a

of

)
to
increase
their
mental
alertness
and
at   -   Rloc-
the
same
time
tap
on
their
wisdom
to
aid
the
community
.

the
society
may
face
with   -   Prep
a
wide
range
of
social
issues
on
education
,
housing
and
many
more
which
may
not
be
solved
by
setting
limits
on
healthcare
expenditure
on
the
government
's
part
but   as this may   Trans
instead
create
even
more
problems
.

for
example
,
new
workers
who
are
hired
to
replace
the
vacancy
of
the
retired
workers
often
lack
experience
and
knowledge
.   ; therefore ,   Srun

moreover
,
the
society
is
already
-   for   Others
well
educated
on
the
way
to
prevent
cancer
.

the
main
objective
in
this   I   Pform
new
technological
research
is
to
search
for
cost
effective
and
sustainable
solutions
to
nuclear
power
(
hejzlar,2005
)
.

instead
of
living
in
the
past
,
they
are
encouraged
to
pursuit   pursue   Wform
their
dream
and
work
towards
their
future
.

in
history
,
the
leakage
-   that   Ssub
happened
in
bhopal
,
india
in
1984
was
a
``
terrible
tragedy
''
(
``
the

''
,
n.d.
)
during
which
``
approximately
3,800
people
died
and
several
thousand
other
individuals
experienced
permanent
or
partial
disabilities
''
(
``
the

''
,

)
.

without
these
extracted

from

can
not
run
,
planes
can
not
fly
,
and
ships
can
not

.

in
addition
to
the
importance
of
sharing   genes   Wform
genetic
test
results
to
reduce
disease
risk
and
practise
family
planning
,
support

not
discrimination
by

is
the
foremost
form
of
assistance
to
those
are
tested
positive
for
genetic
diseases
during
their
illness
.

even
though
the
cost
of
building
a
nuclear
plant
is
-   power generated from   Spar
very
high
,
the
operating
cost
is
relatively
low
.

with
every

into

in

however
,
few   a   SVA
considerations
should
be
taken
into
account
during
the
design
process
.

a
very
powerful
battery
is
needed
to
powered   power   Vform
and
run
the
vehicle
for
a
long
time
and
it
is
only
possible
with
advance   advanced   Wform
battery
technology
.

in

,
the
wfp
has   provided   Vt

this   -   Um

however
,
further
comparison
of
both
the
reactors
base   based   Vform
on
cost
,
performance
and
safety
actually
revealed
(
lfr
)
as
the
better
option
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
i
conclude
that
msr
has
a
better
stand   chance   Wci
over
the
other
reactors
.

car   A car   Nn
-   which   Others
runs
on
hydrogen
does
not
need
heavy
materials
and
much
space
for
its
fuel
tank
.

this
energy
will   is   Vt
be   is   Vt
converted
into
electric
or
thermal
energy
to
serve
our
life
.

it
is
very
unfair
for
his
or
her
family
if
the
result
is
not
disclosed
to
them
moreover   . Moreover ,   Srun
if
the
disease
can
only   -   Rloc-
begin
to
show
any
symptom
only
when
it
is
in
the
final
stage
,
then
the
life
of
the
person
may
be
at
danger
.

for
example
,
the
government   government   Mec
could
top-up   topup   Rloc-
the
medisave
accounts
of
the
less
fortunate
elder
singaporeans
when
there
are
budgetary
surpluses
to
ensure
that
seniors
have
the
capacity
to
afford
healthcare
services
.   -   Rloc-

some
of
the
factors
include
the
lack
of
recharging
stations
and   is   SVA
the
high
cost
of
producing
it
.

in
conclusion
,
limiting
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
aged
does
not
mean
the   ceasing   Wform
cease   ceasing   Wform
the   -   ArtOrDet
expenditure
for   on   Prep
them
.

this
again
will
cost
the
government
even
more
as
now
the
government
will
need
to
support
the
increased
number
of
people
whom   -   Rloc-
are   -   Rloc-
in
needs   need   Nn
.

another
of
such
feature
will
be
homes
with
wider
corridors   wheelchair   Wci
.

people
should
see
these
modifications
as
assets
to
the
neighbourhood
estates
rather
than
expenses
spend   incurred   Wci
on
the
elderly
.

in
the   -   ArtOrDet
contrast
-   ,   Mec
with
the
development
of
the
nuclear
technology
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
application
of
nuclear
energy
on
a
large
scale
,
the
efficiency
of
nuclear
reactors
will
be
improved
gradually
and
the
price
of
nuclear
energy
will
decrease
.

no
one
can
understand
the
current
situation
of
global

better
than
oil-   oil-supplying   Mec

.

in
conclusion
,
today
-   's   Npos
developed
countries
have
been
increasingly
confronted
with
the
aging
process
and
its
consequences
.

the
proponents
emphasized
on   -   Prep
its
high
energy
potential
while
the
opponents
were
so
much
concerned
about
its
radioactive
nature
that
might
cause
harms   harm   Nn
.

with
them   these young adults   Pref
leaving
the
country
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
are
the
ones
who
suffer
because
they
are
being   -   Rloc-
left
alone
and
most
of
the
time
,
their
children
do
not
have
the
intention
of
coming
back
.

this
plan
of
accumulating
savings
by
an
individual
is
compelled
by
law
in
some
countries
and
at
the
same
time
,
while
the
savings
can
help
to
enhance
one
's
responsibility
for
his   their   Pform
own
life
,
they
can
also
provide
him   people   Pref
with
financial
security
after
retirement
.

(
varga,2008
)
this
is
not
necessarily
going
to
happen
as
many
other
factors
are
needed
-   to occur as well ,   WOinc
like
non-genetic
risks
such
as
smoking
(
varga,2008
)
to   -   WOinc
occur   -   WOinc
as   -   WOinc
well   -   WOinc
.

lastly
,
an
ageing
population
would   provide   Vt
mean
the
special
care
needs
to
be
directed
in
order
to
cater
to
the
needs
of
them
.

by
revealing
their
genetic
testing
results
to
their
relatives
,
their
family
members
will
be
able
to
help
them
take
note
of
what
he
or
she
should
avoid
and
assess
the
occupational
risks
at
their
workplace
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
emissions
of
coal
and
oil
industries
are
still
lingering
in
our
atmosphere
,
which
deteriorates   impact on   Wci
the
rate   number   Wci
of
respiratory
disease
.

some
critics
argue
that
limitation   limiting   Wform
to   limiting   Wform
public
spending
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
aged
will
become
a
financial
burden
to
low-income
families
.

for
example
,
monitoring
systems
are
currently
researched
to
allow
the
aged
to
remain
in
their
homes
longer
even
-   if   Trans
they
are
being
treated
with
chronic
diseases
,
rather
than
moving
them
into
a
nursing
home
which
may
incurred   incur   Wform
more
costs
.

however
,
detractors
usually
argue
that
the
effect
of
inflation
rate   countries   Nn
increases   countries   Nn
costs
of
living
steadily
over
the
time
;
as
a
result
,
old
generations
who
retired
in
the
80s
or
90s
are
likely
to
suffer
in
the
current
situation
where
prices
are
highly
inflated
.

secondly
,
the
engineering   unfortunately neglected..   WOadv
education   unfortunately neglected..   WOadv
is
not
focusing
so
much
on
innovation
but
memorizing
.

new
methods
of
healthcare
treatment
often
bring
down
the
cost   for   Prep
of
it
too
.

along
with
it
,
we
have
also
observed
a
huge
increase
in
public
spending
for
elderly
housing   life   Wform
,
healthcare
and
retirement
welfare
.

every
year
,
governments   the government   Others
have   has   SVA
to
spend
around
0.2
%
to
3
%
of

people
and
the
number
is
increasing
year

(

.

instead
of
waiting
-   for   Wci
them
to
lose
their
radioactivity
,
-   a   ArtOrDet
fast
reactor
is
able
to
utilize
most
energy
from
the
remaining

percents   percent   Nn

while
in

actually

a

it   having no limitation on public spending on the aged   WOinc
will

by
the
aged
.

this
technology   -   ArtOrDet
is
largely
applied
in
the
field
of
medical
treatment
today
.

the
fuel
used
in

vhtr
produces
a
large
amount
of
energy
when
burnt
,
thus
reducing
the
amount

such

strategy
translates
to   into   Prep

budgets
and

which
can   could   Vm
be
used
in

areas

therefore
,

this   among   Wci
will
increase
to

%
(
inter-ministerial
committee
on
aging
report

)
.this
is
especially
so
for
developed
countries
where
people
are
living
longer
and
are
less
willing
to
give
birth
due
to
the
high
costs
of
living
.

the
problem
that
the
aging
population
is
facing
right
now
is
the
lack
of
human
resource   resources   Nn
to   -   Rloc-
provide   -   Rloc-
for   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
total   -   Rloc-
population   -   Rloc-
.

globally
,
there
is
a   -   ArtOrDet
rising
concern
on   about   Prep
the
rapidly
aging
of   -   Prep
population
,
especially
in
the
developed
countries
,
for
example
,
the
u.s.
census
bureau
projects
the
number
of
elderly
americans
will
nearly
double
to
71
million
by
2030
.

although
it
would
be
ideal
if
the
government
need   for   Wci
not   for   Wci
have   for   Wci
to
be
'burdened
'
with
expenses
to
care
for
the
aged
,
it
is
not
feasible
.

such
political
circumstances
changed
the
nature
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
design
process
,
and
consequently
,
loosen   loosened   Spar
the
safety
regulations
.

instead
of
helping   giving help   Wci
directly
to
the
needs   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
elderly
,
the
government
should
tackle
the
root
of
the
problem
,   by getting the people   Ssub
which   by getting the people   Ssub
is   by getting the people   Ssub
the   -   Rloc-
people   -   Rloc-
who   -   Rloc-
are   -   Rloc-
supposed   -   Rloc-
to
take
care
of
their
elderly
parent   parents   Nn
.

they
share
with
their
younger
generations
their
limited
monthly
retirement
pensions
or
allowances
to
fulfill   cover   Wci
all
the
costs
of
living
,
and   but   Trans
usually
,
-   they would   Ssub
run
out
of
money
before
the
pensions/allowances
of
the
next
month
come
to
their
hands
.

in
fact
,
one
of
the
measures
includes
the
``
maintenance
of
parents
act
''
(
statutes
,
``
maintenance
of
parents
act
''
,   demandtheir   Wci
chapter   demandtheir   Wci

)
in
which
parents   who n   Vt
can
claim
their
rights
from
their
children
who
had
neglected
them
.

this
might
have
changed
the
course
of
action
of
the
pilots
and
thereby
preventing
the
accident
.

many
pessimistic
predicts
were
made
by
people
about   terms   Wci
this
problem
.

the
public
is
worried
that
nuclear
power
tend   tends   SVA
to
have
higher
operating
and
maintenance
costs
which
will
result
in
them
paying
a
higher
price
than
that
of
coal
and

power
plant   plants   Nn
.

in
-   the   ArtOrDet
banking
sector
,
we
also
can
see
many
weaknesses
,
e.g
.

however
,
the   diseases   Nn

to   -   Rloc-
a   -   Rloc-

body   -   Rloc-
.

this
has
discourages   discouraged   Vt
them
from
attending
the
training
course
as
it
is
conducted
in
english
.

many
policies
for   such as   Wci
example   such as   Wci
-   the   ArtOrDet
maintenance
of
parent
act
,
baby
bonus
scheme
and
later
retirement
agreement
have
helped
to
ease
the
aging
process
significantly
.

we
know
how
iran
and
north
korea
have
been
using
their
nuclear
'power
'
to
negotiate
with
the
us
.

this
may
in
turn
cause
a
clog   clogging   Vform
up
of
cases
where
there
will
be
more
patients
waiting
longer
for
their
operation
-   ,   Mec
reducing
the
quality
of
the
healthcare
sector
(
press
association
,
2005
)
.

these
are
the
universal
steps
in
the
process
which
-   is   V0
followed
by
most
of   -   SVA
the   -   SVA
engineers
.

in
the
truth
about
chernobyl
,
the
author
,
medvedev
(
1991
)
,
notes
that
one
of
the
reasons
which
cause   caused   Vform
chernobyl
accident
is
the
inadequate
operators
with
insufficient
knowledge
operated   operating   Vform
the
reactor
inappropriately
.

despite
the
political
impact
on
the   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear
technologies
in
the
less
developed
world
,
military
forces
are
likely
to
exert
a
similar
impact
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
development
of
nuclear
power
in
those
more
developed
countries
.

increasing
of   -   Prep
public
spending
on
the
aged
will
not
be
able
to
solve
this
problem
.

secondly
,
critics
on
the
other
end
of
the
table   -   Cit
may   -   Cit
argue   -   Cit
that   -   Cit
there   -   Cit
is   -   Cit
the   -   Cit
genetic   -   Cit

non-discrimination   -   Cit
act
(
gina
)
in
the
us
that
was
passed
down
by
the
former
us
president
,
mr.
bush
on
21
may
2008
which
states
that
'the
genetic
carriers
would
be
protect
against
discrimination
when
it
comes
to
work
and
health
insurance
'
(
kaiser
family
foundation
,

)
.

the
country
's
social
stability
will
inevitably
be
disrupted
if
such
-   a   ArtOrDet
policy
is
applied
forcibly
without
any
consent
from
the
elderly
.

however
,
research
shows
that
the
world
is
fast
approaches   approaching   Vt
two
billion
cars
(
sperling
&
gordon
,
2009
)
,
and
this
poses
a
problem
in
the
form
of
environmental
pollution
as
well
as
causing   causes   Spar
adverse
effects
of   on   Prep
our
economy
.

the
health
care
spending
is
also
another
burden
.

we
must
know
clearly   dangerous   Wform
about
the
benefit
vhtr
will
bring
to
us
once
the
research
is
successfully
done
.

once
alternative
solutions
coming   come   Vform
out
,
engineers
need
to
analyze
and
decide
-   on   Prep
bested
suited
solution
to
implement
.government
and
organization
are
also
responsible
to
support
r
&
d
process
in
order
to
gather
information
needed
,
generate
multiple
solutions
,
analyze
solutions
and
test
as
well
as
implement
solutions
which
are
the
necessary
steps
for
the
design
process
.

also
,
those   these   Pref
resources
may
not
be
applied
and
used
everywhere
on
earth
due
to
the   -   Wci
geographic
differences
.

for
example
,
their
limbs
will
get
weaker
,
-   and   Srun
as
a
result
,
this
will
impede
their
mobility
as
they
are
not
as
agile
and
strong
as
before
.

with   Given   Wci
the
outreach
of
the
mass
media
,
reports
of
genetic
disorder
of
an
individual
could
be
known
to
the
world
in
minutes
.

this
is
because
nuclear
reactors
have
a
safety
-   was   Spar
zone
buffer
of
thirty
kilometres
and
singapore
has
a
radius
less
than
that
.

in
modern
society
,
what
we
can
see
and   equipment   Nn
hear
surrounding
us
is
always
about
technology
and
science
.

let
us
consider
the
aspect
of   elderly   Wci
government   elderly   Wci
subsidies
and
grants
.

although
-   the   ArtOrDet
smallpox
vaccine
and
penicillin
have
those   -   SVA
similarities
,
the
procedure
and
development
of
these
two
discoveries
are
different
.

however

can
be
treated   helped   Wci
using
hearing
aids

which
are
readily
available
in
the
market
.

the
individual
has
the
responsibility
to
inform
the
closest
around
him
of
this
genetic
problem
.

however
,
they
should
take
note
that   track   Vform
electromagnetic
waves
are
neither
some
entity
which
can
be
locked
in
a
safe
,
nor
digital
data
which
can
be
stored
in
a
computer
.

it
was
reported
that
the
directly   direct   Wform
cause

every
individual
should
try
to
play
their
part
in
dealing
the
problems
of
an

.

in
conclusion
,
the
new
generation
iv
nuclear
reactor
,
in
particular
the
lead-cooled

,
is
an
optimal
choice
for
future

in
three
fronts
:   -   Mec
safety
,
cost
and

though
there
are
still
many
challenges
lying   -   Rloc-
ahead
.

thirdly
,
in
terms
of
communication
efficiencies   efficiency   Nn
after
the

is
established
,
the
mobile

provides
better

than

there
are
two
main
type   types   Nn
of
classification   -   Rloc-
on   -   Rloc-
medical
imaging
,   :   Mec
invasive
and
non-invasive
.

however
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
taking
such
a
measure
by
the
management
is
a
violation
of
the
employees
'
rights
and
privacy
.

even
-   if   Smod
they
have
the
motivation
,
their
ideas
are
unlike   unlikely   Wform
to
come
true
due
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
lack
of
funding
from
the
government
.

it
is
therefore
crucial
for
governments
to
extend
assistance
to
the
elderly
in
the
form
of
medical
subsidies
,
allowances
,
rebates
and
other
kinds
of
financial
aids   aid   Nn
to
ensure
that
the
needs
of
the
elderly
are
met
and
protected

recently

for
example
,

the
largest
ship
built

,
and
was
equipped
with

furthermore
,   electrically   Wform
having
an
aerodynamically

,
the

and
has
a
powerful

.

opponents
of
gfr
point
out
that
it
is
inevitable
for
nuclear
reactors
to
produce
radioactive
waste
which
has
destructive
effects
-   ,   Mec
and
due
to
the
high
cost
of
pollutant
management
,
it
seems
impossible
to
install
nuclear
reactors
without
any
radioactive
emissions
.

hence
-   ,   Mec
it
is
important
to
inform
the
carrier
's
relatives
so
that
they
could   can   Vt
go
for
the

check
whether
they
are

inherited

despite

he
still

as
far
as
we
know
,
the

be

if

do

come
up
with
new
ideas
,
they
can
not
find

best
solution
for

by

however

whether

depends
on

towards

and
most
importantly
how
it
affects

(

.

one
of
them
is
that
they
both
exist
to
address
problems
that
people
are
facing
at
that
time
of
creation
,
but
differ
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
process
it   in developing   Mec
takes   in developing   Mec
to   in developing   Mec
develope   develop   Wci
the
product
.

the   -   ArtOrDet
scientists
stated   state   Vt
that
coal
and
fossil
fuels
on
earth
are
depleting
at
an
alarming
rate
and
would
be
running
out
in
the
next
century
.

ever
since
the
partial
reactor
meltdown
at
three
mile
island
in
1979
and
the
chernobyl
nuclear
accident
in
1986
,
the
public
feared
that
any
similar
incidents
will   would   Vm
have
grave
consequences
to
the
people
living
around
the   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear
power
plant   plants   Nn
.

the
ubiquitous
gasoline
cars
we
have
around
the
world
nowadays
are
being
slowly
replaced
by   of   Prep
the
electric-powered
cars
.

to
conclude
,
not
only
are
the
renewable
fuels
a   economic and political stability   Wform
lot   economic and political stability   Wform
more   economic and political stability   Wform
eco-friendly   economic and political stability   Wform
,
but
they
also
have
are
widely
and
cheaply
available
.

thus
,
it
is
important
to
channel
the   -   ArtOrDet
funding
to
the
r
&
d
for
gen
iv
reactors
as
they
provide
the
energy
that
will
meet
our
future
energy
needs
.

therefore
,
public
pensions
and   -   ArtOrDet
government
incentives
will
be
a
vital
source
of
money
to
support
these
elderly
that
are
among
those
without
savings
.

however
,
it
is
not
absolutely
true
as
there
is
-   the   ArtOrDet
cpf
policy
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
create   has created   Vt
to
make
the
elderly
support
themselves
.

-   The   ArtOrDet
sodium-cooled
fast
reactor
works
with
quite   -   Rloc-
good
thermal
efficiency
under
a
lower
temperature
when
compares   compared   Wform
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
gas-cooled
fast
reactor
.

here   -   Rloc-
comes   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
question   -   Rloc-
on   -   Rloc-
which   Which   Mec
generation

we
should
choose

however

other   Another   ArtOrDet
challenge
face   faced   Wform
by
design
engineers
is
the
availability
of
technology
.

the
high
operating
temperature
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
core
in
the
vhtr
allows
emissions-free
process
.

reference
:

in
recent
years
,
lots
of
small
companies
-   have   Vform
appeared
in
southern
china
.

once
again
,
the
idea
was
rejected
because
of
cost
issues
.

according
to
a
report
concerning
the
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
population
in
singapore
,
``
there
is
an
increase
of
elderly
living
alone
from
10,400
in
1990
to
25,700
in
2000
.

thereby   Therefore   WOinc
,   Therefore   WOinc
public
spending
should
be
diverted
to
other
areas
to
help
the
needy
and
unfortunate
.

although
it
is
impossible
to
increase
the
fertility
rate
in
the
short
run
,
the
problems
of
aging
process
is   are   SVA
still
alleviated
by
research
and
effective
developments   development   Nn
and
policies
.

actually
,
the
cost
of
nuclear
energy
can
be
divided
into
4
parts
:
the
construction
cost
,
the
operating   cents   Nn
cost
,
the
cost
of
waste
disposal
and
the
cost
of
decommissioning
the
plant
.

does
this   a   ArtOrDet
make
things
clear
enough
now
?

engineering
design
processes
also
involve   involves   SVA
branching
into
different
areas
of
study
and
combining
existing
technology
to
create
new
ones
.

the
family
will
also
be
able
to
start
looking
for
avenues
of
financial
assistance
even
before
the
disease
strikes
.

first
,
the
charging
up
process
should
be
stable
enough
to
avoid   prevent   Wci
damage
to
the
components
of
the
radio
.

lastly
,
the
pace
of
advancement
that
led
to
the
invention
of
the
laptop
and
-   that of   Spar
the
pacemaker
is
different
too
.

people
can   would be able to   Vm
afford
to
look
after
their
elderly
.

though
the
deployment
cost
is
high
at
present
,
the
burden
will
be
shared
by
the
many
countries   are now   WOadv
support   are now   WOadv
the
technology
.

moreover
,
genetic
information
can
also
deny
a
person
with
late
onset
of
the   a   ArtOrDet
disease
of
a
particular
job
,

a
person
with

disease
,
being
healthy
most
of
his

.

therefore
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
vhtr
could
be
a
promising
nuclear
reactor
for
the
``
nuclear
power
's
new
dawn
''
.

however
,
the
design
of
nuclear
reaction
has
to
meet
many
rigorous
requirements
to
avoid
the   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear
releases
as
well
as
to
isolate
the   -   ArtOrDet
radiation
from

for

,
in

however
,
the

does

the

however
,
this
is
not

that
the   -   ArtOrDet

factor
for

it

relatives

they

there

the

therefore

it

a

another
way

the

would
be
to
spend
on
societal

it
is
true
that
to
develop
and
build
a

will
cost
a
lot
-   the   ArtOrDet
of
money
,
but
the
cost
is
reasonable

this
is
no

true

to

,
the
approach

the

directly

however
,
in
this
fast

and
ever
changing
society
,
the
experiences

the

will
get
more

be

the

all
in

,
the
result

is
acceptable

it
is

statistical

that

hence
,
the

.

from   -   Prep
this
comparison

it   -   Rloc-
shows
that

therefore
,
appropriate

are   is   SVA
recommended
to

the
risk
of
explosion
is
lowered
because
no
hydrogen
is
produced
but
it   we   Pref
still
need
to
be
cautioned   cautious   Wci
as
we
are
using

and
sodium
not

explodes
if
it

as

thus
,
the

as
a
result
,
the
percentage
of

there

a

to

in

in

the

the   -   ArtOrDet

helps

so
that
they

are
able

helps
to

there
are
some

conflicts

there

in
the
near

,
the

increase

firstly
,
the

point
is
that

for
these
reasons
,
it
should
be

if
the

on

the

we
can

it

secondly
,
keeping

will
delay

especially
those

unfortunately
,
the
cause   -   Rloc-
of
this

was
found
to
be
unnecessary

made

thus
,
it
will
be
prudent
for
the

commence
its

we
must
deal

thus
,
public

should
be
diverted
to

promoting

which
can
improve
the

according
to

(

,
further

mean
there
will
be

the

one

however
,
many
other
innovations
are   were   Vt
created
in
a
conventionally
generated
environment

initially
,
increasing
the
certain
age
of

would
alleviate
the

.

sfr

a

but
also
the

this
retirement
scheme
helps
to
reduce

as
it
allows
the
elderly
to
have
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in

therefore
,
we

to
begin

the
primary
cause
of
many
nuclear
accidents
is
that   -   ArtOrDet
overheating
of
water
which
is
used
as
the
coolant
in
nuclear
fission
reactions
.

however
,
some
people
have
lost
their
confidences   confidence   Nn
to   in   Prep
nuclear
power
development
after
the
occurring   occurrence   Wform
of
nuclear
disasters
in
three
mile
island
and
chernobyl
.

therefore
it
is
necessary
that
-   being   Vt
the
government
highlight
the
availability
and
benefits
of
their
financial
policies
and
equip
the
aged
with
basic
financial
education
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
these
policies
.

for
example
,
denton
and
spencer
(
1998
)
noted
that
the
rate
of
growth
of   -   Prep
per

gdp
is
certain
to
fall
significantly
over
the
coming
decades
unless
either
the
immigration
rate
or
the
productivity
growth
rate
increases
rather   -   Rloc-
dramatically
.

even
though
scwr

not
been

yet
,
it
is
proved
to
have
less
possibility
to   of causing   Wci
cause   of causing   Wci
nuclear
accidents
that   as has   SVA
happened
before
;
it
is
easier
to
implement
compared
to
other
generation
vi
reactors
,
and
it
has
a
relatively
high
thermal
efficiency
which
makes
its
long-term
cost
relatively
low
.

in
conclusion
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
.

therefore
,
the
individual
requesting
genetic
testing
should
have
the
final
say
in
whether
to
reveal
the
result
of
such
testing
,
since
the
individual
will
be
the
one
answerable
and
holding   holds   Vt

in

factors
,
the

already
contributed
many
years
of
their

to
the   -   ArtOrDet

.

by

,
it
helps
to
ease
the
financial
burden
of
the
patient
and
their   his or her   Pref
family
.

in
addition
,
this
would
lead
to

they

the

offer
a
lucrative   promising   Wci
solution
to
the

through
their
very
high
efficiency
in
conversion
of
thermal

to

when   -   Rloc-

elders
who

would
be
able

keep

through

therefore

it

in
this
case
,
the

been

thus

it

that
by

the

there

mankind

most   and   Srun
experts
agree
that

one

is

used
in

more

in
general
,
the
benefits
of
knowing

far
outweigh
the

adverse

as
the
future
of

prices
continue   continues   SVA
to
rise
due
to
the
scarcity

and
increase
in

by

,
this
will
inevitably
led   lead   Wform
to
a

this

in

thus

even

financial
support
from

,
the

due

this

thus

it

with
the
increase
of

for   on   Prep
the

,
there
will
be
many
areas
that
may
be
left
out
if
-   the   ArtOrDet

focused
only
on
the
welfare
of

from

the
most
important

is
to
have
a
huge
sum
of
fund
for

and
commercial
purposes

we
should
spend
more

certainly
at   -   Rloc-
this   -   Rloc-

transformed
the

experience
of

the

should
also
support

financial
problems
as

come   -   Um

besides
,
the   -   ArtOrDet

makers

plant   plan   Wform
to
extend
the
financial
security
of
the
elderly
through
either
rising   raising   Vform
the

prolonging

today
,
it
has
become

the

allow

with
all
this   these   ArtOrDet
concerns
on
the
use
of
nuclear
power
,
it
seems
that
nuclear
power
poses
more
of
a
problem
than
a
-   solution as a   Spar
beneficial
energy
source
.

the
cost
of
nuclear
fuel
is
as
low
as
0.5
cents
per
kilo-watt
hour
which
is
one
quarter
of
that
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
gas
power
plant
.

besides
,   addition   Wform
elderly
workers
can
get
abused
just
as
much
as
younger
workers
,
by
considering
the
fact
that
if
elder
workers
were
to
be
dismissed
for
some
reasons
,
finding
another
employment
with
equal
remunerations
and
similar
job
tasks
might
not
be
easy
.

but
this
method
has
some
disadvantages   shown   Wci
.

despite
this
,
singapore
was
not
really
badly
overthrown
by
usa
's
economic
deficit
due
to
the
government
's
strong
policies
in
handling
such
-   a   ArtOrDet
situation
.

as
long
as
we
can
find
a
way
to
increase
the
amount
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
energy
the
batteries
can
store
,
the
cost
will
not
be
much
a
problem
anymore
.

with
these
inventions
,
people
nowadays
are
leading
comfortable
lifestyle   lives   Wci
and
-   the   ArtOrDet

are   is   SVA

this
is
because
the
-   a   ArtOrDet

would
be
able
to
track
the
locations
of
the
convicts
and
hence
would
be
more
willing
to
allow
these
convicts
out
of

and
into
society

hence
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
safety
of
the
nuclear

has
always
been
the
main
issue
regarding   surrounding   Wci
the

as

our

to

on

more
relevant
and
crucial
areas
like
military
,
urban

and

these
results
may
not
be
the
same
for
all
countries
because
each
country
has
their   its   Pref
own
unique
way
of
implementing
different

another
value

its

rising

the
key
is

the

a
reason
for
the
stand
that

is
that
the

not

though
there
are

now
,
the

with
proper

to

up
,
countries   less   Wform
can
not
only
find
no
need
to
increase
their

on

they
may
also
find
themselves
spending
lesser
which
can
also
mean
that
more
funds
can
be
allocated
to
other
areas
of

.

since
vhtr
is
one
of
the
better
options
among
the

iv
nuclear

and
it
is
feasible
,
we
should
invest

and

further
research

development
on

according
to
the
ministry
of
community
development
,
youth
and
sports
,
the
elder   elderly   Wform
(
age
65
and

)
population
in
singapore
is
at
8.6
%
(
2008

and
it
is
expected
to

to

by

in

their   its   Pref

in
contrast
,
when
focusing
on

,
particularly
economic

,
the

therefore   In addition   Trans
,   In addition   Trans
the   In addition   Trans
development   In addition   Trans
of   In addition   Trans
healthcare
facilities
to
meet
growing

would
inevitably
raise
public

on

with   By   Prep
imposing

law
,
people
feels   feel   SVA
safer
to   when undergoing   Wci
undergo   when undergoing   Wci
genetic
testing
;   testing   Wci
being   as it is   Wci
the
deciding
factor
to
disclose
their
genetic
results
to
family
members
or
third
party
under
their

.

i
advocate
the
idea
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
patients
should
have
the
final
say
to
decide
whether
to
disclose
the
test
results
to
relative   relatives   Nn
and
families
.

although
it
can
affect
the
family
drastically
,
it
is
better
to
be
prepared
rather
than
be
caught
on
by
surprise
.

two
main
problems
are
singapore
's
small
economic
market
and
its
population
holding
a
resistance
to
change
attitude   -   Rloc-
.

after
test
results
are
analyzed
by
physicians
,
there
is
a
dilemma   dilema about whether   Wci
if   dilema about whether   Wci
the
information
should
be
made
known
to
others
or
-   whether   Trans
it
being   should be   Spar
kept
confidential
by
the
individual
.

according
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
singapore
department
of
statistic   Statistics   Nn
,
the
life
expectancy
of
singaporean
has
increased
noticeably
to
78.0
for
male
and
to
82.8
for
female
(
as
cited
from

.

after
all
,
the
benefits
of
this
measure
will
definitely
outweigh
the
expense   limitations   Wci
,
and
-   the measure   Others
is
able
to
cut
down
the
amount
spent
in
the
medical
sector
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
future
.

this
problem
is
because
of
our

comings
in

for

another

two
major
problems
among
these
are
:
the
low

the

some
argue
that   -   Nn
a
genetic
elimination
in
choosing
worker
is
discrimination
because
this
is
an
action
of
limiting
one
's
right
to
work
(
andre
and
velasquez

)
.

thus
we
can
not
infer
that   dynamite   Wci
serendipity
occurs
when
scientists
use
wrong
methods
to
achieve
the
result
.

as
such
,
they
can
age
with
more
convenience
and
hence
improving
their
connectivity
with
others
.

in
1985
,
the
emergence
of
a
prototype
``
puma

''
pointed   ted a   Rloc-
out
a
new
way
to
do
surgery
,
and
that
is
robotic
surgery
.

researchers
have
come
up   -   ArtOrDet
with
several
ways
to
improve
and
slow
down
the
deterioration
of
elderly
brain
.

healthcare
for
the
elderly
is
important   able   Vform
in
order
to
enable
them
to
lead
better
lives
.

this
may
cause
the
working
people
to   fail   Wci
be   fail   Wci
under   fail   Wci
pressure
and
financially
strapped
.

last
but
not
least
,
some
will
question
why
helium
with
low
thermal   convinced   Wci
conductivity
is
chosen
as
coolant
,
given
that
some
other
coolant
,
for
instance
molten
salt
,
allows
better
electric
conversion
efficiency
than
a
helium-cooled
vhtr
operating
at
similar
conditions
.

given
such
a
life
and
death
situation
,
engineers
have
responded
and
there
have
been
many
great
inventions
,
of
which
the
implanted
pacemaker   smooth heart beat   WOinc
might   smooth heart beat   WOinc
be   smooth heart beat   WOinc
one
of
the
most
significant
engineering
products

diseases
.

furthermore
,
poor   these   Wci
elderly
can
not
afford
expensive
medical
bills
,   -   Um
but   -   Um
they   -   Um
should   -   Um

.

however
,
the
low
fertility
rate
in
singapore
challenges
this
argument
because
the
financial
burden
resulting
from
the
provision
of
aged
parents
is
currently
increasing
on
the   -   ArtOrDet
fewer

.

to
a
large
extent
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
process
has
been
alleviated
with   by   Prep
the   -   ArtOrDet
current
social
policies
and
implementation
that
emphasise
individual
responsibility
,
familial

often
known
as

government
policies
and
priorities
also
play
an
important
role
to   in   Prep
the
development
of

.

however
,
the
recent
two

witnessed

astonishing
innovation
in
photographythe   photography . The   Mec
development
of

which   -   Rloc-
has

that

moreover
,
the

.

secondly
,
revealing
the
result
of
genetic
testing
would
help
in
making

decisions
.

in

,
the

rose
from

to
37.3
in

,
and
is
forecasted
to
increase
to
45.5
by
2050
.

thus
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
research
on

should
be
continued
and
funded
to
get

therefore
,

however
,
the

are
the

aging
issues
are
very
complicated

not

indomitable
.

therefore
,
public
spending
on
the

should
be
limited
to
prevent
misuse
of
funds
that
could
be
better
channeled
back
to

,
where

would

the

development
of
this

is
mainly
contributed
by
three
factors
:
public
's
needs
,
economic

and
government
regulation
.

by
talking
to
their
relatives
about
their
genetic
risk
,
they
will
gain
support
and
encouragement
.

at
first
,
the
idea
of
designing
laptop
was
disapproved
by
the
toshiba
company
,
which
at
that
time
has   had   Vt
just
suffered
from

huge
loss
in

these   These   Mec
viruses
are
very
contagious
and
their

have   show   Wci
a

symptom
,   -- -   Mec
fever
.

however
,
without
being
warned
of
the
possible
risk
of
inheriting
these
diseases
,
they
would
probably
not
go
for
their
own
genetic
testing
and
hence
would
run
the
risk
of
having   undergoing   Wci
a   -   ArtOrDet
late
treatment

a
disease
related
to

genetic
disorder

which
may
have
catastrophic
consequences
.

by
achieving
security
and
economic
stability
,
then   -   Rloc-
a
country
will
be
able
to
exist
.

no
doubt
that   -   Rloc-
it
is
essential
to
take
care
of
the
elderly
who
have
contributed
much
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
society
during
their

,
but
the

must
still
ensure
that
there
is
enough
funding
on

areas

take

in

because

be

however

we

and
thus
should
create
leverage
on
this   elderly   Wform

.

given
my
above
two
reasons

may
argue
that
the

according
to

(

,
at

2009
there
are   were   Vt
436

supplying
an

's
total

.

too
much
of
the
nation
's
budget
is
-   being   V0
spent
on
aiding
the
elderly
and
the
government
should
limit
and
channel
these
funds
to
other
more
important
areas
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
country
's
development
.

the
money
could
also
go
into
building
cost-saving

hence
attracting

these
areas
will
affect
how

a

can   -   Rloc-
support

another
worry
in
the
use
of

that
whenever

the

are
threatened
as
their

can
be
revealed
(

.

while   while   Mec
viewing
from
the
latter
would
suggest
that
it
is
due
to
the
societal
factors
that
has
shaped
the
technology
today
(

hence

the

enormous

therefore

we

that   -   Rloc-
the

the
last
and
perhaps
the
most
significant
difference
in

have   has   SVA
to
be
the
difference
in
the
features

rather
than
having

it

for
example
,
public

should
be
spent
on
the

under
a
better
mechanism
through
more
practical

like
encouraging
the

to
be

if

in

demand
of   for   Prep
a
more
convenient

however

if

country
is
able
to
find
a
way
to
improve
cleanliness
in   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
country   -   Rloc-
,
this
will
no
doubt
lead
to
a
healthier
population
,
which
in
turn
means
lower
medical
costs
.

since
the
individual
who
undergoes
the
testing
is
the
direct
victim
from
this
examination
and
most
related
to
the
result
,
the   he or she   Pform
one   he or she   Pform
should

the

to

although
the
reactor
was
eventually
cleaned
up
and
decontaminated
,
the
damaged   damage   Wform
dealt
to
nuclear
power
was
irreversible
and
caused
its
subsequent
decline

after
years

the

published
six

our

which
also
means
that

as

said   the saying goes ,   Wci
prevention

thus
the

had   is   Vt
constantly

other
than

we

the

innovation
starts   occurs   Wci
when
there

a

when
someone
faces

and
motivates

this
could

the

this
will
definitely
reduced

such
a

will

in

in

the

and
of

the

hence
,
the
public

under
the
retirement
act
(
1999
)
,
the

singapore
raised
the

age
for

elderly
from

to

the
success
of
innovation
is
generally

much
more
considerable
than
conventional

even
a
quite
small
mistake
may
lead
to

(

therefore
,
with
the
genetic

at

,
family
members
can
decide
whether
to
bear

in

taking
into

all
of

there

no

at   -   Rloc-

all
these
make
it
even
more
difficult
for

the

that

it

hence

the

would
not

at

the
final
argument
advanced
by

is
that
while

,
it
also
poses

for

they

on
the

,
we
can
also
tap
on
the
vast
experience

of
the
older

who
can
then
continue
to

in

is

critics

position
say

in

,
even
though

we   -   Wtone
can   -   Wtone
see   -   Wtone
from

that

despite

various

there
are
still
numerous

as

the
nation

infrastructure

and

are
in
a
desirable
condition
and
the
current
spending
on
it   them   Vt
is
adequate
to
sustain
these   -   Rloc-

and   -   Rloc-
economic

.

moreover
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
manufacturing
industry
also
needed   needs   Vt
attention
from
the
government
since
manufacturing
is
satisfying
the
citizens
.

then
,
another
opposed   opposing   Wform
argument
being
raised
states
that
building

nuclear

will
make
the   countries   Nn

more
vulnerable

thus
,
even
with
increasing   -   Rloc-
hearing
problems
,
the
elderly
can
still
make
use
of
the
available
hearing
assistive
technology
to
help
them
in
their
daily
tasks
.

however
,
with
the
world
noticing
the
shift
in
it   its   Pform
's   its   Pform
demographic   demographics   Wform
to
a
more

society
,
things
are
becoming
more
accommodating
for
the

.

unprecedented
advances
in
technology
resulted
from
extensive
research
and
implementation
of
different   have   SVA
creative
policies
have
make
the
process
of
aging
more
pleasurable
.

thus
,
it
is
essential
that
countries
start
reviewing
and
emplace   -   Um
new
changes
where
necessary
.for
instance
,
one
step
singapore
has
taken
is
restructuring
their   her   Pref
healthcare
system
where
elderly
patients
are
treated
by   in   Prep
-   an   ArtOrDet
acute
hospital
followed
by
recuperation
in
a
community
hospital
.

at   As   Trans
such
,
a
win-
win
situation
can
be
achieved
as
we
not
only
ease
the
aged
population
but
also
assist
in
country   The Country 's   ArtOrDet
expansion
.

however
,
this
would
create
an
impression
that
the

are
unwanted
and
-   being   V0
left
alone
.

there   Therefore , there   Trans
would   should not be a   Vm

need
to
divert

of   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
public
spending
on
the
elderly
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

thus
,
with
the
potential
-   the   ArtOrDet
``
loophole
''
being
dealt
with
,
the
tax
relief
scheme
will
be
able
to
help
in
lessening
the
financial
burden
that
the
children
have
to
take
on
from
looking
after
their
parents
.

they
also
need
to
address
the
fears
of
the
public
so
that
people
are
more
aware
of
the
advantages
of
nuclear
energy

we
will
discuss
on   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
differences   -   Rloc-
on   -   Rloc-
whether
to
limit
the
public
spending
of   on   Prep
the

.

instead
,
millions
of
small
companies
are
operating
their
small
business
everywhere
,
and
large
transnational
corporations
are
enjoying
their
profit
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
chinese
market
.

humans
need
a
car
which
-   is   V0
not
only
able
to
transport
them
easily
but
also
-   is   V0
friendly
to
the
environment
.

supporters
claimed   claim   Vt
that
third
generation
power
plants
would
be
cheaper
as
well
as
faster
to
construct
than
second
generation
power
plants
-   ,   Mec
by
previous
experience
of
constructing
nuclear
power
plants
.

thus
it
is
not
simply
a
tool
,
but
a
personal
belonging
to
reprsent   represent   Mec
their
appitite   appetite   Mec
and   to modernise   Trans

in
conclusion
,
i
do
think
that
a   -   ArtOrDet

the

initially
opposed
to
the
idea

this
is
being   -   Rloc-

decreased

among
all
these
six
generation

,
i
think
very-high-temperature   the very-high-temperature   ArtOrDet
reactor
is
the
most
promising
one
.

most
of
the

proved
that

can
continue

contribute
to

thus
their

to

throughout

in
addition
,
funding
remained
a
major
problem
of
technology
development
because
science

every
steps
in   create   Vform
an

are
expensive
.

knowing
the
difficulties
in
encouraging

the

decided
to
carry
out
research

have   implement   Spar
implemented   implement   Spar
policies

hence
,
one

secured   secure   Wform
to

genetic

results
to

military   The military   ArtOrDet
could
also
look
at
offering

as

as
hiring
freelance

from
foreign
countries
(

.

the
main
reason
for
this
is   was   Vt
because
of
the
investment

consideration

decision
made
by

it

the
urgent

predicted

even
though

according

there
are
``

which
still
affect
any

to

but
apart
from

the
development
of

mainly

this

the

-   since   Trans
nobody
can

so   -   Rloc-

therefore
,
that
normal

are
not

restricts
the

of

in
china
.

as
an
older
population
will
directly
result
in
lower

and
higher
social

cost
in
a

,
many
sociologist   sociologists   Nn

are

bringing

hoping
that

in

since

the

has
came   come   Vform
to
see
the
threat

therefore

it
is
encouraged
to
reveal

especially
to

and
then
they

they

in

in
this
situation
,
the
behaviors
of
the

are
the
key
factors
which
directly
determine
the
successful   success   Wform
of

in

therefore
,
when
the   -   ArtOrDet
economic
growth

stable

this
will
lead
to
avenues

vast

to
further
develop

and
also
result
in

however
we   -   Wtone

thirdly

firstly

with

the

thus
,
it
is
important
to
keep
improving
our
current
research
on
technological

and
government
policies
on

that
have   -   Wci
helped
to
ease

,
as
the
benefits
are
definitely
worth

.

-   The   ArtOrDet
u.s.
used
more
than
six

people
and
invested
more
than
two

to

.

if

failed
to

they
have
to

there
are

these
elements

such
that
it

therefore

however

this

that
more

can
be

to
make
the   an   ArtOrDet
efficient

engineers
carefully
define

this
essay
argues
that
public

one
of
the
most
major
categories
almost   -   Rloc-
governments   that   Pref
recently   have recently invested   Vt

should
be
limited
for
developing
other
countries
'
important
areas
,
promoting
their
sustainable
growths
,
and
forming
people
's
responsibilities
.

this
is
done
by
implementing
policies
like
the
medisave
system
,
where
singaporeans
have
to
put
aside
a
certain
percentage
of
their
income
into
the
medisave
account
.   -   Rloc-

also
,
they
contend
that
most
would
be   infrastructure   Nn
unwilling
to
volunteer
during
their
'golden
years
'
,
thus
wasting
the
government
's
efforts
to
increase
volunteering
opportunities
for
the
elder
population
.

firstly
,
contributions
to
society
made
by
the
elderly
can
not
be
ignored
.

as   Because   Rloc-
compared   Because   Rloc-
to   Because   Rloc-
vhtrs   Because   Rloc-
,   Because   Rloc-
because   Because   Rloc-
the
gen
iv
's
vhtr
systems
are
built
on
the
older
generation
of
high
temperature
reactors
,
therefore
many
of
the
safety
systems
which
already
existed
in
the
old
reactors
,   -   Mec
are
further
being
enhanced
,   . In   Trans
therefore   . In   Trans
in   . In   Trans
this
way
,
the
safety
systems
in
vhtr
does   do   SVA
exceed
the
ones
in
lfrs
.

through
-   the   ArtOrDet
engineering
design
process
,
we
can
see
how
engineer   engineers   Nn
satisfy
that
need
.

``
the
privatization
of
public
transport   held   Wci
has
not
delivered
the
improved
service
standards
nor
shorter
arrival
times
,
while
fares
have
been
increasing
based
on
the
justification
that
being
private
transport
operator
,
they
are
not
charity
and
need
to
make
profit
for
their
shareholders
.
''

some
feel
the   -   ArtOrDet
state
has
gone
too
far
by
intruding
on
the
delicate
relationship
between
children
and
their
parents
.

conversely   On the other hand   Trans
,
others
might
argue
that
by
not
limiting
the
public
spending
on
aged
means
that
lesser
budget
will
be
allocated
to
other
areas
of
singapore
's
development   developments   Nn

such
as

sectors

in
contrast
to
the
above
,
although
public
spending
on
the
aged
is
essential
,
there
is   -   ArtOrDet
also
a
need
for
investment
of
resources
in
the
educational
sector
to
provide
better
education
for
the
younger
generation
.

as
our
prime
minster
lee
hsien
loong
highlighted
in
his
2009
national
day
speech
,
``
if   for   Prep
we
stay
cohesive
,
then
we
can
overcome
our
economic
challenge
and
continue
to

''

in
singapore
,
where
there
is
a
reasonably
low
birth
rate
and
top-notch
health
care
which
helps
prolong
people
's
lives
,
population
aging
is
inevitable
,
hence
being
prospective-looking
,
the
strategy
that
is
feasible
would
be
to
reallocate
of   -   Prep
funds
and
attention
on   to   Prep
other
areas
,
in
particular
,
education
and
tourism
.

despite   However , despite   Trans
some
elderly
being
more
active
than
others
,
most
elderly
find
it
difficult
to
move
about
.

despite
this
effort
,
private
sectors
are
still
not
incorporating
desirable
features
in
their

due   Thus , due   Trans
to

special
application
in

and
the

it

in

during

it
is

that

this

that
we

the
only
way
to
satisfy
the
increasing
demands
of   for   Prep
space
is
by
achieving
a
better
usage
of
the   -   ArtOrDet

if
the
government
decides
to
cut
its
expenditure
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
aging
population
,
the
elderly
will
be
struggling
for
their
survival
as
many
welfare
benefits
will
be
limited
.

money
can
then
be
diverted
to
other
areas

the

which
maybe   may be   Wci
of
better   greater   Wci
use
for   to   Prep
the
future

,   .   Srun
it   This   ArtOrDet
will
also
make

however
,
there
is
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
government   governments   Nn
in
developed
countries
has   have   SVA
already
pumped
in
a
huge
amount
of
money
to
develop
the
main
areas
of
development
like
education
and
national
defence
.

with
the
inflating
cost
of

care
in
singapore
,
it   the government can not avoid implementing   Wci

necessary   -   Rloc-
schemes
such

nevertheless
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
introduction
of
msrs
still
deserve   deserves   SVA
strong
support
as
they
-   are likely to   Others
prove
to
be
the
best
solution
for
improving
energy
efficiency
and
developing
renewable
energies
.

the
reason
why
we
should
focus
on
the
research
of
solar
energy
is
that
the
atmospheric
pollution
caused
by
the
consumption
of
fossil
fuels
is
severe
,
-   and   Others
there
is
enough
amount   -   Rloc-
of   -   Prep
solar
energy
to
be
used
on
earth   Earth ,   Mec
,
and
the
diffusion
and
adoption
of
solar
energy
product
is
satisfying
.

in
addition
,
the
close
helium
or
nitrogen
brayton
power
cycles
were   are   Vt
adopted
thus
allowing
the
high
temperature
generated
by
the
msr   MSRs   Mec
to
be
efficiently
used
.

in
addition
,
countries
like
singapore
has
started
to
tackle
aging
problems
where
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
is
getting
companies
to
rehire
workers
aged
62
.

with   Hence , with   Trans
the
help
of
psychology
design
,
the
rates
of
accidents
may
reduce
drastically
.

although
there
are
still
flaws
in
the
current
policies
,
shortcoming   shortcomings   Nn
of
one
policy
can
be
overcome
with
other
policies
and
developments
.

to
find
a
solution
to
that
problem
-   ,   Srun
certain
amount
of
the
public
spending
has
to
be
diverted
to
it
.

three
of
these
problems
are
safety
,
efficiency
and
practicality
.

they
cite
examples
of
the
nuclear
devastations
in
chernobyl
and
japan   the   WOinc
atomic
bomb
at
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
in
1945
.

the
cost
of
supporting
and   an   Mec
old
person
is
by   -   Prep
no
doubt
majorly   largely   Wci
due
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
increased
medical
costs
that
come
with
old
age
.

although
many
beneficial
services
has   have   SVA
been
provided
to
the
elderly
,
this
program
still   -   Rloc-
does
not
seem
to
be
so
effective
as
volunteers
may
or
may
not
render
their
services
whenever
the
elderly
need
them
.

such
an
enormous
amount
would
be
several
annum
of
singapore
's
gross   resources   Wform
domestic
product
in
the
current
economic
climate
.

(
bouchard
,
&
bennett
,

)
furthermore
,   become   Wci
the   become   Wci
use
of
nuclear
power
to
generate
electricity
would
not
increase
the
risks
of
global
warming
.

hence
,
i   it can be argued   Wtone
agree   it can be argued   Wtone
that
the
government
should
limit
their
expenditure
on
the
elderly
so
that
money
can
be
focused   directed to   Wci
on   directed to   Wci
other
aspects
for   of   Wci
the
country
's
development
.

in
addition
,
the
electric
cars
are
definitely
more   does not offer good value for the money spent   Wci
expensive   does not offer good value for the money spent   Wci
than   does not offer good value for the money spent   Wci
their   does not offer good value for the money spent   Wci
gasoline   does not offer good value for the money spent   Wci
counterparts
despite
the
fact
that
they
offer
lesser
range
.

lastly
will
the
implementation
of
policies
result
in
increase
or
decrease
in
public
saving
and
investments
.   ?   Mec

based
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
research
,
the
number
of
people
suffering
from
alzheimer
's
disease
rise
``
from
around
2.8
million
people
to
5.1

the

``

''
.

first
of
all
,
one
of
the
biggest
obstacles
that
hamper
the
engineering
design
process
in
my
country
is
the
lack
of
resources
-   ,   Mec
which
includes
both
factors   -   Rloc-
:   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
human
resources
and
natural
resources
.

study   A study   ArtOrDet
has
shown
that
outdoor
parks
and
regular
exercises
have
therapeutic
effects
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
to   in   Wci
improve   improving   Vt
their
health
and
wellness
,
-   as well as   Trans
increasing
their
muscle
strength
and
stimulate   stimulating   Spar
-   their   Pref
spiritual
developments
.

due   Thus   Trans
to   Thus   Trans
this   Thus   Trans
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
.

also   In addition   Trans
,
serendipitous
new
ideas
can
be
generated
by
anyone
.

oppositions
have
very
good
reasons
to
go   heightened   Wform
against
nuclear
reactor
development
especially
after
the
911
incident
and
the
chernobyl
disaster
.

besides
safety
,
convenience
is
also
desirable
for
identifications   identification purposes   Wci
.

therefore
,
during
any
emergency
process
,
the
required
human
intervention
was   is   Vt
minimized
.

in
addition
,
the
location
may
not
be
accessible
to
some
elderly
-   ,   Srun
especially
to   for   Wci
those
who
are
physically
disabled
.

people
do
not
know
how
to
make
use
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
new
technologies
and
new
products
so
that   -   Rloc-
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
situation
where
engineering
design
processes
for
innovations
receive
not
much
or
little
support
from
the
public   Chinese government   Wci
in   Chinese government   Wci
china   Chinese government   Wci
and
people
.

through
constant
exchange   exchanges   Nn
of
information
about
the   -   ArtOrDet
problems
,
human
needs
and
wants
,
we
can
come
up
with
better
ideas
to
solve
problems
and
make
our
world
a
better
place
to
live
in
.

the   -   ArtOrDet
thousands
of
petrol
stations
will
have
to
close
for   -   Rloc-
no   -   Rloc-
business   -   Rloc-
;   -   Rloc-
petrol
related
service
industries
will
also
be
severely
affected
.

since
the
test
involves
genes
and
in
general
,
every   -   Um
human   -   Um
has   -   Um
it   -   Um
,
the
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
should
be
obligated
to
tell
his
or
her
relatives
.

in
addition
nuclear   -   Rloc-
waste   -   Rloc-
is   -   Rloc-
not   -   Rloc-
plutonium   -   Rloc-
,
in
the
sfr
the
recycled
plutonium
could
be
a
security
threat
.

in
a   -   ArtOrDet
short
,
encouraging
later
retirement
of
employee   employees   Npos
remains   is   SVA
-   an   ArtOrDet
effective
solution
to
reduce
the
burden
of
old
aging   age   Wform
.

furthermore
generation
iv
reactors
are
able
to
produce
more
energy
,   ; thus ,   Srun
thus   ; thus ,   Srun
the
cost
of
the
energy
would
be
cheaper
.

measures
are
also
in
place
to
keep
nuclear
-   the   ArtOrDet
proliferation
in
check
.

so
they
collaborated
with
some
officials
to
protect
their
own
benefits
.

besides
efficiency
-   ,   Mec
,
vhtr
also
shows
its
potential
in
two
other
aspects
.

in
its
early
days
,
nuclear
power
was   with   Prep
seen
as
offering
a
potentially
limitless
source

this

with
this
pressing
issue
aging   of aging   Prep
population
.

one
example
of
this
could   is   Vform
be   is   Vform
the
extension
of
access
to
most
public
places
and
even
on
public
transport
vehicles
for
people
with
physical
disabilities
,
such   through   Wci
as   through   Wci
designing
paths
or
elevators
specialized
for
wheel
chairs
,
or
placing
special
directions   directional signs   Wci
for
the
elderly
with
sight
or
hearing
problems
.

these
also
allow
the
elderly
to
be
independent
as
they
no
longer
need
to
rely
on
other   others '   Nn
's   others '   Nn
help
with   in   Prep
their
daily
life
.

as
such
,
the
genetic
information
nondiscrimination
act
(
gina
)
is
implemented
to
prevent
health
insurers
and
employers
to   from   Prep
discriminate   discriminating   Vform
against
a
person
's
genetic
predispositions
(
allison
,

)
.

however
,
it
is
really
hard
to
meet
all
the
needs
of
the
rapid
innovation-development
in   -   Um
the   -   Um
past   -   Um
.

at
block
level
,
as   -   Rloc-
mention   -   Rloc-
earlier   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
lifts
are
improvised
to
stop
at
every

if   -   Rloc-
feasible   -   Rloc-
and
additional
features
such
as
-   the   ArtOrDet
widening
-   of   Prep
the
lift

for

and
-   the   ArtOrDet
lowering

are
included
for   -   Rloc-
elders   -   Rloc-
'   -   Rloc-
beneficial   -   Rloc-
.

however
,
the
increased
health
costs
should
not
be
depended   borne   Wci
solely
by
the
government
.

as
a
result
,
the
effectiveness
and
some
concealed
weakness   weaknesses   Wform
of
the
design
are   will   Vt
not
able   -   Rloc-
to   -   Rloc-
be
fully
traced
during
the
test
.

another
factor
that
affects
-   the   ArtOrDet
bar
code
's
development
is
the   -   ArtOrDet
economic
concerns
.

besides
,
there
is
other
option
available
other
than
cutting
the
spending
on
the
elderly
in
order
to
have
more
money
for
other
development   developments   Nn
.

in
conclusion
,
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
is
obligated
to
tell
his
or   -   Prep
her
relatives
as
communication
of
genetic
test
results
can
bring
about
improved
management
and
well-being
of
carriers
and
their
families
,
resolution
of
concerns
,
possible
reduction
in
disease
occurrence
,
as
well
as
effective
prevention
,
treatments
and
even
cures
.

although
the
vhtr
also
has
its
own
challenges
in
r
&
d
,
it
is
,
besides
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
,
highly
interested   interesting   Wform
in   to   Wci
by   to   Wci
the
experts
.

in
conclusion
,
due
to
the
law
issues
and
the   -   ArtOrDet
possible
undesirable
emotional
stress
-   caused   Others
by
relatives
,
the
individual   individuals   Nn
should
have
the
final
say
in
revealing
the
results
,
as
it
is
their
personal
information
,
and
that   -   Rloc-
they
understand
the   their   Pref
relatives
emotionally   better emotionally   WOinc

.

as
solar
power
is
actually
inexhaustible
and
reproducible   -   ArtOrDet
,
they
can
use
it
whenever
they
want
and
it
is
free
of
charge
as
well
.

an
ageing
population
is
a
worldwide
pattern   issue   Wci
that
is
faced
by
all
countries
.

in
conclusion
,
the
nation
needs
to
sacrifice
the
elderly
temporarily
for
the
benefit
of
everyone
.

under
the
same
standard
,
we
can
clearly
see   we should   WOinc
the   we should   WOinc
efficiency
of
the
vhtr
is
better
.

now
when
they
are
old
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
they
can
not
continue
to
do
productive
work
,
so
it
is
our
society
's
responsibility
to
support
them
.

in
view
of
the
graying
population
,
government
expenditure   -   ArtOrDet
on
the
aged
is
inevitable
.

however
,
occupational

the

motivation

attitude
and
decision-making
(

)
.

firstly
,
genetic
testing
has
led
to
the
ethics
of
medical
professionals
being
questionable
.

it
also
comes
with
a
reminder
system
-   to   Ssub
,
on-screen
instruction
and
a
line
of
communication
.

thirdly
,
safety
of
the
employees
working
at
the
nuclear
plant   ago   Mec
and
the
residents
near
the
plant
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
.

the
absolute
priority
that
they
possess
should
be
balanced
by
awareness
of
averting   disorders   Nn
medical
harm
to

this

recognising
the
problem
of
a
possible
financial
burden
that
might
be
incurred
by

the

are

the

if

on

economics

as
a

public

so

besides

it

the

behind

if

,
rfid

should

as
it
does
not
inflict   infringe   Wci
the
privacy
of
people
and
gives
advantages
in
many
aspects
in
human
life
.

in
the
following   -   Rloc-
essay
,
i
shall
discuss
the
problems
that
are
brought
about
by
the
increase
in
public
spending
on
the
aged
and
the
areas
that
could
have
been   -   Vt
benefited
if
the
fund
is   were to be   Vt
used
on
them
instead
.

the
heat
and
high
amount
of
electricity
generated
by
the
molten
salt
-   's   Npos
reactor
,
on
the
other
hand
,
can
be
said
to
be
constant
and
can
be
further
tapped
into
for
the
production
of
hydrogen
(
duffery
,
2005
)
.

all
in
all
,
the
strategy
on   of   Prep
reducing
elder
dependency
through
the
3
methods
can
prove
to
be
valuable
for
an
aging
society
.

the
generation
iv
international
forum
(
gif
)
has
been   researched   Vt
research   researched   Vt
in   on   Prep
the
six
different
types
of
nuclear
reactor
methods
which
they
think
that   -   Rloc-
it   -   Rloc-
will   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
prospect   -   Rloc-
way   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
producing   will produce   Vform
nuclear
energy
.

as
carbon
dioxide
emission
soars
and
energy
demands
increase   have increased   Vt
rapidly
recent   in   Wci
years
,
the
nuclear
option
is
finding
its
way
to
the
table
.

however
,
if
we
use
natural
energy
,
we
can
not
only
reduce
the
emission
of
green
house
gas
,
but
also
save
our
resource   resources   Nn
.

thus
the   -   Rloc-
importance   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
education
is
equally
important
.

it
would
be
an
anti   anti-elderly   Wci
elderly   anti-elderly   Wci
society
where
they   the elderly   Pref
would
most
likely
stay
at
home
.

although
more
hospitals
were
being
built
but   ,   Rloc-
many
old   -   Rloc-
aged
patients
with
financial
problems
ca
n't
afford
themselves   -   Rloc-
to
-   go to   V0
these
hospitals
.

so
in
this
way
,
the
impulsion
for
designing
and
processing
innovations
has
been
greatly
encumbered
.

luckily
,
modern
medicine
can
provide
us   -   Rloc-
with   -   Rloc-
procedures
to
cure
our   -   Wtone
serious
diseases
and
to
prevent
aging
.

in   -   Prep
this   This   Mec
case   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
privacy   -   Rloc-
matter   -   Rloc-
can
be
assured
by
applying
password
,
encrypter
or
decoder
in
the
next
generation
of
rfid
devices
.

with
the
limitation
of
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
the
elderly
might
not
receive
essential
healthcare
due
to
insufficient
funding
,
which
may
leads   lead   Vform
to
undesired
outcome   -   Nn
.

all
these
requirements
are
fully
passed   met   Wci
just   -   Rloc-
by
those
who
are
well
educated
.

in
my
opinion
,
this
is
the
most
useful   engaged   Vt
method
to
reduce
the
fiscal
and
economic
cost
.

this
action
has   would have   Vm
an
adverse
impact
on
the
company
.

the
future
is
unknown
.

concluding   -   Um
this   -   Um
,   -   Um
the   A   ArtOrDet
country
will
be

progress
if

besides

it
also
costs

large
amount
of
money
to
deal   dispense   Wci
with

and
radioactive

.

as
the

the
need
to
stay

a
country
to

as
a
result
of
such
overheating
under
high

immense

for

therefore

certain

proving
to
be
as
stable
as
another   others   Vform
that
hold
fewer

but
is   are   SVA

there
are
several
limitations
to
the   well-off   Rloc-
extent
of
how
the
productivity
can
be
increased
among
these
workers
.

also
,
many

it
is

that

thus

i
agree
to   have   Vt
a

policies
have

to

hence
,

vhtr
is
worth

the

and
the

however

these

one

this
is
where

that
means
it
will

what

the

to
solve   address this need   Wci
this   address this need   Wci
,
an
engineering
process
has
to
be
developed
and
this
requires
a
methodology
or
a
process
of
steps
to
help
us
arrive
at
the
solution
.

along
with
the
improvement
of
living
standards
,
people
have
got
used
to
the
sedentary
lifestyle
-
having
a
seat
all   -   ArtOrDet
day
without
any
exercise
.

thus
,
there
are
an
increasing
number
of
concerns
as
to
how
to
solve
the
problems
of
an
-   have   Vt
aging
population
.

if
each
person
has
a
sense
of
responsibility
towards
increasing
the
size
of   was   SVA
today
's
economy
and
tax
base
,
then
it
will
be
not
a
big
problem
for
us
to
spend
more
money
on
the
aged
.

first
of
all
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
public
are   is   SVA
against
the
proposal
of
building
nuclear
power
plant
to
supply
electrical
energy
as
they
are
very
concerned
with
safety
of
the
plant
.

hence
,
they
will
prefer
a
petroleum
car
which
has
a   the   ArtOrDet
potential
in   to allow   Wci
allowing   to allow   Wci
them
to
travel
farther
.

as
a
consequence
,
r
&
d
may
become
the
last
choice   in   Prep
for
some
talents
.

as
technologies
of
modern
society
,
both
-   The   ArtOrDet
refrigerator
and
-   the   ArtOrDet
microwave
oven
have
practical
meaning
.

therefore
,
the
government
had
implemented
the
three
m
policies
-medifund
,
medishield
-   's   Npos
and
medicsave
.

therefore
,
the
government
introduce   introduces   SVA
the
baby

scheme
which
enlighten   lightens   Wci
the
financial
cost
of
raising
children
.

healthcare
service
is
very
essential
to
the
elderly
as
they
are
more
prone
to
illnesses   .   Mec
therefore   Therefore   Mec
by
lowering
the
cost
of
healthcare
,
elderly
can
have
more
money
to
use
in
other
areas
of

more
should

done
to   start   Wci
ensure
that
they
get
the
appropriate
healthcare
subsidies
and
proper
facilities
for
them
to
stay
healthy
.

this
would
result
in
less
toll
on
the
elderly
body   -   Rloc-
as
the
wound
is
smaller
and
thus
able
to
heal
faster
.

this
is
due
to
the
ascending
numbers
of
elderly
in
the
coming
years
that
we   need to be dealt   Wtone

)
.

as
friedland
and
summer
(
2005
)
suggested
,
with
more
economic
growth
,
the
country
will
be
able
to
have
more
choices
and
more
resources
to
invest
into
the
elderly
healthcare
sector
.

despite
the
complex
changes
in
the
environment
,
there
are
theories
on
successful
aging
which
could
help
us
in
our
investigation
on
to   -   Prep
the
extent
of   to which   Wci
the
current
policies
have
helped
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

therefore
,
it
would
be   suffer   SVA
desirable
to
have
the
elderly
join
the
workforce
as
they
could
serve
to
aid
in
the
economy
with
their
spending
power
and
even
reduce
their
need
for
social
welfare
,
which
can
be
highly
taxing
to
an
economy
.

by
doing
this
,
hopefully
there
are
chances
to
prevent
accidents
because
of
misuse
caused
by
the
misunderstanding
of
instructions   use   Wci
,
like
the
operator
in
the
chernobyl
accident
.

although
the
vulnerable
may
be
perceived
as
the
one   ones   Pform
with
vast
knowledge
and
experiences   experience   Nn
,
the
young
is
likely
not
to
overlook
this
matter
.

students
are
always
'spoon-fed
'
by
the
teachers
.

in
singapore
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
are
entitled
to
a
subsidy
of
75
per
cent
of
the
fees
charged
at
polyclinics
and
even
free
medical
service
for
frail
or
disabled
elderly
.

thus
,
-   people   Wci
public
funding
is
still
necessary
to
help
elderly
who
are
in
financial
need
and
also
to
promote
social
welfare
services
for
them
.

most
of
them
feel
unsecured
because
the
cost
of
petrol
may
lead
the   to   Wform
low
profit
or
even
red
deficit
.

firstly
,
revealing
of
genetic   such results   Wci
test   such results   Wci
may
cause
the
individual
to
be
genetically   -   Rloc-
discriminated
-   against   Others
(
norrgard
,
2008
)
.

therefore
,
public
spending
is
essential
due
to
the
high
healthcare
services
fees
,   overall   Wci
the
lack
of
resources
to
support
the
growing
numbers
of
aged
and
the
labour
input
of
the
aged
in
the
society
.

hence
-   ,   Mec
a
carrier
should
tell
his
or
her
relatives
of
the   his   Pref
genetic
test
result
as
discrimination
by
relatives
is
rare
.

furthermore
,
these
findings
fail
to
address   attempts   Nn
the
exigent
issues
of
aging
societies
presently
facing
.

yet
that
token
of
gratitude
should
not
be
too
-   of   Prep
much
till
it
may
drag
down
the
development
of
the
country
.

as
a
result
,
all   -   Rloc-
the
rest
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
process
can
be
ruined
because
of
the
first
steps
,   ;   Srun
for
example
,
if
the
problem
statement
is
not
broad
enough
,
the
statement
will
preclude
the   -   ArtOrDet
new
thoughts
on
the
issue
.

when
the
individual
is
discovered
for
having
a
genetic
disorder
and
not   does   V0
declaring   declare   Vt
the
status
beforehand
,
the
individual
will
bear
all
the
consequences
,
which
includes
genetic
discrimination
since
the
individual
had
the
choice
to
weigh
on   -   Prep
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
matter
before
the
individual
made
a
decision
on
keeping
the
condition
to
himself
.

this
is
a
computer
program
that
reminds   will remind   Vt
the
elderly
-   of   Prep
the
time
-   to take their medicine ,   Wci
and
also   -   Rloc-
the
type
of
medicine
to
take
.

too
much
intruding   intrusion   Wform
of
privacy
could
also
lead
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
psychological
factors
of
one
's
mental
status
.

besides   Furthermore   Wform
,
most
countries
in
the
world
have
regarded
anti-terrorism   fighting terrorism   Wci
as
one
of
their
main
tasks
in
the
future
.

in
conclusion
,
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
or
diverted
as
-   ,   Mec
for
a
developed
country
like
singapore
,
many
successes
are   have been   Vt
brought
about
by
them
and
they
-   have   Vt
helped
shaped
the
country
to   into   Prep
what
it
is
today
.

imaging   One can imagine   Sfrag
living
in
a
country
like
sri
lanka
where
people
live
in
fear
everyday
with   because of   Trans
its   the   ArtOrDet
never
ending
wars
between
the
local
army
and
the
liberation
tigers
of
tamil
elam
.

this
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
most
people
with
disabilities
or
diseases
are
discriminated
-   against   Others
.

therefore
,
with
great
foresight
and
careful
planning
,
the
governments
could
better
prepare
themselves
for
the
up
surging
numbers
of
aging
population
by
implementing
the
right
policies
and
investing
in
the
areas
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
country
's
development
that
will
benefit
both
the
aged
population
and
the
general
society
.

then   However   Wtone
again   However   Wtone
,
there
is
always
the   an   ArtOrDet
opposite
side
to
the
issue
.

this
is
because
unlike
our
neighbouring
countries
,
which
has
aplenty   abundant   Wtone
of   abundant   Wtone
natural
resources
,
we
have
only
a
form
of
natural
resource
,
that
is
our
people
.

so
if
their
incomes
are
limited
,
it
must
arouse
complaints
and
evokes   evoke   SVA
the
indignation
.

engineers
try
to
solve
overpopulation
by
combine   combining   Vform
many
houses
into
one
building
,
thus
building
multi-unit
housing
-   ,   Vform
or
also
known
as
attached
dwellings
-   ,   Vform
has
been
invented   initiated   Wci
.

this
achievement
,
however
,
raises
a
controversy
of
whether
an
individual
who
requests
genetic
testing
should
have
the
final
say
to
reveal
or
not
reveal
the
results
of
such
testing
.

while   -   Rloc-

in
conclusion
,
current
research
and
development
have
indeed
helped
the
elderly
in
their
aging
process
in
the
ways
as
mentioned
above
.

however
,
as
we
know
,
the
life
of
the
sun
is
more
than   will be   Vm
billions
of
years
.

however
,
deciding
on
how
much
the
government
should
contribute
is
a
feat
as
a
society
has
many
needsit   needs . It   Mec
is
the
role
of
the
government
is   -   Rloc-
to
weigh
which
issues
should
be
focused
on
in
the
short
and
long
term
.

with
regards   regard   Nn
to
this
,
the
prime
minister
of
singapore
,
mr.
lee
hsien
loong
-   , had   Mec
had
reassured
the
public
that
the
government
will
continue
to
revise
the
initiatives
to
make
sure
that
the
elderly
can
work
longer
with
ease
.

as
a
result
,
the
elderly
,
who
depends   depend   SVA
on
the
fund
,
would
have
the
mindset
of
not
saving
up
for
-   an   ArtOrDet
emergency
or
the
thought
of
having
longer
working
period   periods   Nn
.

in
other
words
,
this   -   Rloc-
means   -   Rloc-
we
need
a
policy
so
that
money
can
be
dispersed   disbursed   Wci
appropriately
.

(

-   .   Mec
it
can
be
seen
that
because
of
time
constraint
,
the
research
and
development
engineers
from
creative
technology
had
to
sacrifice
most
of
their
time
just
to
focus
on
the
engineering
design
processes
for
their
new
product
,
zen
,
so
that
it
can
be
completed
as
soon
as
possible
.

due
to
the
need
to
maintain
results   confidentiality of results   Wci
confidentiality   confidentiality of results   Wci
,
doctors
will
be
compelled
to
watch
patients
with
the
defective

fall
ill
when
appropriate

can
be
done
to
avert
the   -   ArtOrDet
harm
.

reference
:

by
applying
this   it   Trans
figure
,
the
number
of
plants
calculated
by
the
opponents
can
significantly
be
minimized
.

in
conclusion
,
the
structure
of
-   China 's   Others
education
and
policy   China 's policies   Others
on
engineering
and
industry
are
two
significant
problems
which

this
can
be
achieved
by
completely
abolishing   setting aside   Wci
already
available
engineering
processes
,
modifying
and
improving
these
old
processes
,
or
correctly
identifying
the
reasons
for
the
rise
of
that
need
.

so   In the process   Trans
we
can
see
many
firms
and
companies
start
to
invest
in
solar

areas
.

(

however
,
these
policies
may
not
be
effective
because
due   -   Rloc-
to   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
influx   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
immigrants   -   Rloc-

locals
view
foreign
workers
as
a
threat
and
may
cause
social
unrest

so
,
increasing
the
awareness
of
filial
obligation
will
result
in
more
children
taking
care
of
their
elder   elderly   Wform
parents
and
help
to
ease
the
country
-   's   Npos
aging
process
.

although
-   the   ArtOrDet
society
has
a
moral
obligation
to
do
all
that
it
can
to
help
the

,
there
are
still

as

to
first
please
their

then

they
therefore
will
have
to
think
more
when
spending

reducing   will try to reduce   Vform
wasting

therefore

from

due
to

in
effect
,
the

because
the

is
greatly   well   Wci
taken

and
they
will
not

the

for
example
,
after

people

find
out
that

consequently

some

firstly

the

although
the

what
our

the

will
help

however
frank
's
model
was
more
recognized
than   economies   Nn
han

due
to
two
reasons
.

elderly   Many elderly   ArtOrDet
with
chronic
illnesses
may
have
complex
medical
backgrounds
.

they
stated
that
when
engineers
or
designers
design
with
human
psychology
in
through
,
they
could
produce
a
design
that
can
prevent   has been   Vt
accidents
from
taking
place
.

britain
has
introduced
a
compulsory
pension
scheme
in
2006
where
the
employees
-   an   ArtOrDet
have
to
contribute
4
percent
of
their
monthly
pay
while
their
employers
have
to
contribute
3
percent
.

to
sum
up
,
even
though
the
challenger
was
designed
with
some
serious
flaw   flaws   Nn
and
destined
to
fail
in
such
a
cold
environment
,
appropriate
psychology
could
still
be
implemented
to
prevent
the
accident
from
happening
,
as
long
as
-   the   ArtOrDet
decision
of
the
launch
was
made
with
surety   confidence   Wci
and
the
potential
dangers
found
by
the
engineers
were
cleared
up
.

otherwise
,
most
of
the
engineering
design
for
innovation
could
be
a
failure
without   -   Rloc-
any   -   Rloc-
success   -   Rloc-
.   -   Rloc-

nevertheless
,
the
budget
for
healthcare
is
not
infinite
,
so
,   -   Mec
the
government
and
policy
makers
must
decide
at   to   Wci
which
extent
they
would   will   Vt
give   subsidize   Wci
-   the   ArtOrDet
healthcare
cost
to   of   Prep
an
individual
,
depending   and this would probably depend   Others
on
his
own
financial
capacity
.

limitations
and
transparency
can
be
made
to
gain
back
the   -   ArtOrDet
confidence
level   -   Rloc-
towards   in   Prep
public
spending
.

as
for
biomedical
,
it
is
the
design
of
devices
intended
to   -   Rloc-
be
used
in
medicine
.

it
is
true
that
the
aged
is   are   SVA
able
to
support
himself   themselves   Pform
by
being
financially
independent
.

insurance   For instance , insurance   Trans
company   companies   Nn
may
use
the
information
to
raise
rates   premiums   Wci
or
to
deny
the

insurance
.

thus
,
when
they
want
to
use
this
insurance
plan
for
any
emergency
uses   use   Nn
,
they
can
use
it
anytime
.

being
occupied
with
work
,
the
aged
could
actually
use
their
brains
more
frequently
and
this
reduces
the
chances
of
getting   developing   Wci
senile
dementia
and
parkinson
's
diseases
significantly   -   Rloc-
.

higher   -   Um

means
that

it

be
used

hydrogen   hydrogen   Mec
which
holds
much
potential

even
though
the

aging
population
,
public
spending
should
not

the
second
thing
is
that

able
to

to
wrap
up
the
discussion

the
controversy

although
the

there
will

be

in

this

other

this

however

another
outcome
of

is
that
,   -   Mec
both
the
younger
and
older
generations
will
better
understand
what
could
happen
to
them
when

this

according
to
thinkquest
,
their
worries
are
not
unfounded
as
the
lapse
in

safety
of
nuclear

led
to
two
devastating
nuclear

which
happened
on

pennsylvania
,
in
1979
and
at
chernobyl
in

in

.

with
development
in
both
education

,
foreign
investors
will
choose
to
set

thus

the

from
it
,
the
country

may

benefit
since
they

they

finally
,
they
came
up
with
their
research
results
after
many
years   -   Rloc-

,
in

according

on

the

at

time
,
better

will
not
only
improve
the
earning
of
the
working   work   Wform

,
but
also
the
moral
of

however
,
because
of

and
many
other
relevant

,
various
kinds

threatening

,
especially
the

hence
,
we
would
save
more
than
what   advocates   Wform
we
would
have
initially
spent
on
the
building
of
the
nuclear

over

china

long
been
a
great
country
of

,
but
the

success
of

quite
rare
.

public

should
not
be
limited
as
the

despite
this
,
the
nuclear

-   how   Others
has
already
an
established
safety
system
and
stringent
checks
,
and
over

,
the

would
be
able
to
prove
its

during

in

one
of
the
challenges
is
the

this

nowadays

illiteracy

some
might
disagree   argue   Wci
that
even
though
they   the elderly   Pref
can
not
compete
with
the
younger

for

,
the
government
does
organize
job
fairs
to
help

elderly
seek
jobs
.

however
,
these
aids
have
proven
to
be
essential
despite
the   their   Pref
costly
structures
.

b.c
.

we
should
stop
destroying
our
earth
by
continue   continuing   Vform
mining
and
generating
electricity
through

coal

for

without

these

however
,
such

becomes
harmful
in

long
run
as
the
innovative

of

this
way
,
the
government
reduces
the
financial
dependency
of

elderly
by
providing
help
based
on
their
financial

also
,
more

will   -   ArtOrDet
become

even
without

in

the

not

among
of   -   Prep
them
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
entertainment
industry
should
be
mentioned
as
the
most
noticing   obvious   Wci
one
.

in
this
protocol
,
the
member
countries
have
to
reduce

certain
amount

according
to
the
amount
of
green

gas
they
produced
and
the
most
acceptable
way
is
just
reduce

activities

this
would
be
proved   -   Rloc-
beneficial
in
the
short
run
,
when
facing
emergencies
,
or
in
the
long
run
,
when
facing
retirement
.

in
the
more
developed
regions
,
the
number
of
persons
aged
over
60
would
increase
by
70
%
-   to be   V0
from
231
million
in

to395

in

in
addition
,
the
state
enforces
its

retirement

whereby

in
conclusion
,
people
may
be
upset
with
this   the idea of limiting public spending on the elderly   Others
idea   the idea of limiting public spending on the elderly   Others
because
they
may
think
that
the

increasingly
lack

however
,
leaders
in   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-

must
realize
that
as
more
money
is
spend   spent   Vt
on
easing
the

process
,
future
public
spending
will
be
limited
and
this
could
have
-   a   ArtOrDet
negative
impact
on
future
generations
.

that
is
why
if
researcher   researchers   Nn
can
overwhelm   overcome   Wci
that   the   ArtOrDet
problem
,
then
-   the   ArtOrDet
new

will
have

which
is
``
clean
,
secure
,
plentiful
,
dependable
,
cost-effective
,
secure
from
terrorist
attacks
and
proliferation
resistant
''
.

to
address
this
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
gfr
system
has
involved
measures
to
enhance
pr
&
pe
and
has
adopted
an
actinide

to
ensure

and
availability

this

becomes

if
the

does   do   SVA
not
have
any
children
or

who
choose
to

therefore
our
challenge
will
be
to

the
increase
in
social
spending
as
our
population
ages
,
and
-   to   Spar
focus
subsidies
on
those
most
in
need
.

despite   Nevertheless , despite   Trans
this
solution
,
the
elderly
are
still
struggling
to
cope
with
the
latest
technology
.

according
to
rogers
(
2003
,   -   Cit
the   -   Cit
generation   -   Cit
of   -   Cit
innovation   -   Cit
)
,
there
are
six
main
stages
of
this
process

namely
the

research
,
development
,
commercialization
,
diffusion
and
adoption
and
the
stage
of

.

on
the
other
hand
,
public
spending
in
infrastructure
development
attracts
more
private
investment
,   ;   Mec
hence
generates   generating   Vform
greater
income
.

thus
,
in
order
to
apply
earlier
prevention
for
the
family
,
the
individual
should
reveal
the   his   Pref
result
.

later
retirement
not
only
secures
a
better

,
but
also

thus
helping
them
to
maintain
their
standard
of
living
during

.

the
closed

will
reduce
the
waste
as
well
as
the
necessity
of
plutonium
reprocessing
.

elderly   The elderly   ArtOrDet
may
not
be
receiving
the
most
appropriate
medical
help
.

without
knowledge
,
an
engineer
can
not
start
his
designing
process
because
he
does
not
know
where
to   stage   Nn
begin
and
what
to
create
.

supporters
related
the
accident   feedback   Nn
to
a
lack
of
understanding
in
human
psychology
during
the
design
phase
(
reason
,
1988
)
.

therefore
,
they
are   were   Vt
unwilling
to
take
risks
,
and
stick   stuck   Vt
to
known
methods
that
work   worked   Vt
.

on
the
contrary
,
focusing
on
improve   improving   Wform
the
management
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
engineering
processes
is
already
a
way
of
applying
social
psychology
.

however
,
when
trying
to
convert
solar
energy
into
electricity
so
that
it
can
be
easily
transmitted
,
engineers
should
consider
the
cost
and
utilization
of
solar   -   Um
panels   -   Um
.

not
only
,
can
the
notified
family
members
know
of
the
consequence
they
might
face
,   .   Mec
some   Some   Mec
can
be
treated
during
the
fetal
stage
of
the

.

the
young
generation
should
be
grateful
to
their
senior
citizen
's
contribution
because
the
prosperity
of
today
's   systems   Nn
country
is
built
by
the
older
generation
when
they
are
young
.

the
various
issues
regarding
an
aging
population
as   right   Wci
laid
out
in
this
essay
are
serious
problems
faced
by
most
developed
countries
around
the
world
.

hence
the
sales
of
the
laptops
increased
substantially
and
the
companies
make   made   Vt
profits
.

other
accidents
in

history
also
revealed
the
lack

``
the
best

,
as

a

,
more
savings

thus
be
build
up
.

so   Therefore   Trans
,
we
need
to
create
machines
which
consume
less
energy
.

this
convenience
was
-   due to   Trans
the
fact
that
gasoline
was
portable
and
could
be
brought
around
on
vehicles
which
allowed

most

to

complex

china
and
one
has
to
put

much
effort
to
establish
and
maintain
interpersonal
relationships
.

hence
,
there
would
be
a
need
for
governments
to
increase
expenditure
on
the
aged
to
accommodate
to   -   Prep
this
burgeoning

the

the

faster

therefore
,
this
is
one
of
the
major
factors
that
will
definitely
affect

prior

faced

that

the

basing

nobody   However , nobody   Trans
ever
told

there

thus
,

most

we

this

discourages

frankly
speaking
,
nuclear

share
a   the   ArtOrDet

basic
theoretic
foundation-the

not

our   the   Wtone

therefore

the

is
quite

this
applies

in
most
of   -   Rloc-

the

causes
are
errors

this
would

the
reason

one
of
such
is
that
the

might
need
to
channel
more

to
meet
the

the

it

if

she
might
lose

to
conclude
,
there
are
many

while
a
country
has

focus   worker   Nn
on

sectors
of
development
and
most
likely
funding
for
the

is
not
a

concern
,
its
funding
should
never
be

.

ergo   That is   Wci
,
nuclear

especially
for   that produced by   Others
the

,
is
a
much
cleaner
source
of
energy

-   so   Trans
further
research

development
should
be
done
on

hence
,

decided
to
take

now

as

the

the

secondly   The second reason   Wci

are

the

for

provided
that
they
are
either

this

the
great
knowledge
of
many
talented
engineers
has
fulfilled   helped to fulfill   Trans
many
human
requirements
,
which
results   -   Vt
directly
to   impacts   Wci
an
ordinary

.

many
diseases
that
have
plagued
mankind
in
the
past
are
now
curable
or
can
be
vaccinated
.

it
is
apparent
that
the
negligence
of
the
engineering
teams
was
to
be
blamed
for
the   has   SVA
accident
.

therefore
,
we
-   even   Others
can
not
blame
our
forefathers
for
not
being
innovative
when
it
comes
to

.

in
order
to
reduce
the
stresses
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
central
provident
fund
(
2009   -   Cit
)
was
set
up
as
a
compulsory
savings
scheme
in
singapore
so
that
they
can
use
this
savings
to
support
themselves
in
their
old
age
.

moreover
,
many
have
expressed
their
desire
to
work
longer
as
they
want
to
feel
valued
and
be   being   Vt
able
to
contribute
to
the
society
.

with
the
decline
of
fertility
rate
in
recent
years
,
statistics
have
shown
that
in
singapore
,
the
number   ratio   Wci
of
younger
persons
age   aged   Wform
15-64
to
every
resident
aged
65
and
above
fell
from
10.4
in

to
7.5
in
2009
.

the
benefits
of
surveillance
technology
conspicuously
outweigh
the
concerns
about
human
privacy
issues
that
are
so
often
brought
up
by
human
rights
bodies
and
the
law
(

.

with
few
responses
from
local
consumers
,
it
is
really
tough   changing   Wci
for
the
innovation
of
engineering
design
in
china
.

however
,
one
must
be
reminded
that
there
are

according

the

about   of   Prep
emphasizing
filial

and
increasing
the
willingness
of
grown
children
(
peterson
,

)
is
not
an
easy
feat
.

in
my
opinion
-   an   ArtOrDet
,
the
root
cause
is
the
human
factor
,
the
wrong
decision
made
by
the
officials
.

it
is
true
that
the
early   by   Wci
investment
of
vhtr
is
much
higher
than
the
existing
normal
nuclear
reactor
or
others
;
however
,
the
vhtr
could
produce
50
%
more
electricity
from
the
same
amount
of
fuel
compared
with
other
conventional
plants
,
and
its
deign
life
is
as
long
as
60
years
compared
with
40
years
of
the
normal
nuclear
reactors
.

furthermore
,
located
just
closed   close   Wform
to
clouds   cloud   Nn
level
,
the
airport
area
had
a
very
special
fog
pattern
.

consequently
,
networks
were
able
to
connect
to   -   Vt
different
parts
of
the
world
.

but
from
my
point
of
view
,
i
believe
nuclear
energy
can
make   bring   Wform
much
more
benefits
than
the   those   Wci
lost
.

in
addition
,
people
are
having
less   lesser   Wform
,
if
not
,
no
children
these
days
.

regardless
of
how
technologies
are
developed
,
they
will   present   Wform
definitely
benefit
people
.

currently
,
as
engineers
,
we
should
work
on
an
advance   advanced   Wform
model
of
-   the   Others
catalytic
converter
,
with
a
higher
efficiency
and
better
compatibility
with
different
models
of
engines
which
may
emit
harmful
gases
.

in
order
to
change
their
mindset
,
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
in
the
future
,
and
in
turn
use   the money used   Spar
the   the money used   Spar
money   the money used   Spar
for
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
like
education

.

this
is
due
to
countries
becoming
more
affluent

and
thus
have   people   Sfrag
better
living
environment
and
are
also
more
educated
to
be

other
than

the

thus

therefore
,

therefore

it

for

all

show
that

played

in

where   when   Trans
the

an

now

the
challenge

to

therefore
,
when

fast

this
group
as

keep   keeps   SVA
increasing

for
example
,
suppose
an

is
looking
for
a
material
for
meal
boxes

taken-away   take-away   Wform
food

though   -   Rloc-
singapore
sees
an

as
a

it
channels
sufficient

at
the

time

focusing

however
,
some

might
think
that
living

their
parents
is
very   -   Rloc-
-   a   ArtOrDet
nuisance
because
they
need
a
lot
of
care
and
attention
.

therefore
,
governments
should
reduce
their
spending
on
the

and
invest   -   Rloc-
more
money   -   Rloc-
on   -   Rloc-

coping
with
fast
ageing
in   among   Prep
singaporean   Singaporeans   Nn
is
a
slow
and
tough
process
which
requires
both
the
government
and
its
citizens
to
work
closely
together
.

during
this
process
,
the
surgeon
has
no
direct
access

it   the system   Others
relies
largely
on
verbal
exchanges
between

the

to
coordinate
the

procedures
.

statistics
have
shown
that
over
the
past
decade
,
the
percentage
of
elderly
has
risen
from
7.0   .   Mec
%
in
1999
to
7.8

the

furthermore
,
the

rock-like

before

embedded
into

whose

is
about

however
,
the
favourable
vhtr
has
advantages
in
performance
,
safety
and
cost
that
outweighs
those
of
the

and
thus
should
be

support
for

and
development
.

having
a

of
61
percent
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
it
is
quite
difficult
to
introduce
new
technological

as
not

would
understand

know
how
to

we
should

since
the

be

the

on
the
other
hand
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
sfr
is
more
sustainable
because
of
its
closed

and
excellent
potential

in

,
working
helps

become
more

more

and
healthier
.

in
such   a   ArtOrDet
society
accompanied
by
materialism
and
ageism
,
the
needy

will
be
pushed
to
their

in
conclusion
,
there
could
be
some
laws
pass   passed   Vform
down
to
settle
all
these
ethical
issues
.

they
also
point

abuse

since
they
are

,

create   creates   SVA

everyone
a

which
can

and
save

(

foucault,1979   Foucault , 1979   Cit
)
.

in   Furthermore , in   Trans
contrast
to
the
sfr
,
the
vhtr
is
resistant
to
nuclear
weapon
proliferation
as
it
abandons
the
reprocessing
process
.

in
singapore
,
the
central
provident
fund

(

is
a
saving
scheme
that
covers
any   -   ArtOrDet
working
singaporean   Singaporeans   Nn
with
a
list
of
welfare
benefits
and
offers
a
sense
of
security
for
their
old
age
.

however
,
the
producers
are
trying
to
produce
the   -   ArtOrDet
products
particularly
for
the
old
.

therefore
as
all
the
tests
have
shown
,
the
potential
of
leaking
and
being
unstable
during
operation
can
-   a   ArtOrDet
be
rendered
as

it
is

infrastructure
is
another
area
where

should
be
set

for

it

everyone
in

long

.

the
first
problem
that
hinders
engineering
design
processes
for

is
the
great   -   Rloc-

of

.

thus
,
this
also
shows
that
all   -   Rloc-
the
aging
population
in
singapore
is
being
well
taken
care
of
by
the

since

financially
,
we
also
should
not

assume
that
all

unable

financially

this
is
because
the

hence
,
these

essentially
,
the

this

until   -   Rloc-

it   It   Mec
is
undeniable
that

is
still
one
of
the
current
issues
that
are
affecting

therefore
-   ,   Mec
the

should
not

of
employment
by
providing
more
incentives
for
employers
to
attract
such
workers

due

however
-   ,   Mec
this
burden
can
be
lessen   lessened   Vt
if
the
elderly
mindset
is
changed
.

nuclear
reactors
are
being
built
by
the   -   ArtOrDet
engineers
who
make
and
distribute
out   -   Wci
the
nuclear
energy
.

however
,
because
of
lacking
resources
and
unpromising
market
,
the
innovation
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
laptop
in
toshiba
was
nearly
aborted
.

according
to
the
book
by
ullman
,   -   Cit
david   -   Cit
g.   -   Cit
(
2009
)
,
there
are
ten
building
stages
in
the
engineering
design
processes
.

many
counties
are
paying
more
and
more
attention
to
the
healthcare
system
as
the
proportion
of
the
old
population
increasing   increases   Vt
.

but
people
have
unlimited
wants
,
they
are
not
contented   content   Wform
with
just
the
laptop
with   which   Wci
is
considered
quite
bulky
at
times
,
thus
they
demanded
laptops
that
are
smaller
,   and   Mec
lighter
.

this
functionality
comes
only
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost   technical   Wform
and
weight
of
the
laptops
.

hence
,
the
supporters
believe
that
the
new
generation
of
nuclear
reactor   reactors   Nn
should
make
use
of
this
technology
.

second
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
should
also
divert
the
money
into
the
environment
.

the
former
remote
controller
has
larger
buttons
and
the
words
on
it
are
printed
in
greater   bigger   Wci
font   fonts   Nn
than
usually   the usual   Wform
ones
.

for
example
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
sweden
and
the   -   ArtOrDet
australia
have
similar

outcomes   -   Um

as   -   Um
measured   -   Um

.

due
to
the
aging
population
-   ,   Srun
there
is
a
shrinking
workforce
,   ; and   Srun
so
-   the   ArtOrDet
government
should
spend
more
on
education
-   ,   Srun
so
that
it
will
increase
the
productivity
of
the
workforce
.

in
summary
,
it
is
unwise
for   programs   Nn
the
government
and
policy
makers
to
solve
the
aging
problems
in
china
by
simply
increasing
public
expenditure
on
the

all

to

failure
caused
by

lastly
,
investments
can
be
made
on
healthcare
to
empower
the

to
take
charge
of
their

health
.

scientists
have

air
pollution
is
the
main
reason
why
the

quality
thus
we
should
look
at
ways
to
cut
down
on   -   Prep
air
pollutants   pollutant   Wform
emission
.

however
,
rather
than
to
discriminate
-   against   Wci
and
despise
the
elderly
,
we
should
put
in
more
effort
in
trying
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

statistics
shown   show   Vform
that

still
engage
in

and
the
elderly
who
take

in

are
47

less

due
to
the   -   ArtOrDet

thus

but
fortunately

we

very
smart

careful

who
were
able
to
find

and
find
a

to

though
the

are

,
they
become
useless
as   like   Wci

in

with

,
i
do
not

moreover
,
opponents
may
also
argue
that
the

rather   in   Prep
a
pure
theory
with
no

,
so
that

as

for   After   Wci
more
than
20
years
of

,
medical
robots
are   have becomee   Vform
one
of
the
great
inventions
in
this
modern   -   Rloc-

.

i
believe
this
is
one
of
the
reason   reasons   Nn
why

refused   refuse   Vt
to

a

this

therefore
,
we   still induces   Wci
can
say
that

is
the
safest

to

plants
.

secondly
,
detractors
argue   does   SVA
that
consumers
would
prefer
to
use
other
forms
of

due
to
their
cost
competitiveness
.

in
conclusion
,
we
should
limit
public
spending
on
the

in
order
to
ensure
that
we
can
be
more

efficient
and
ensure
that

better

as
such
,
technology
nowadays
needs
not
only
to
prove
its
functionality
but
also
spend
efforts
on   in   Prep
creating
its   -   Pref
awareness
since
it
is
up
to
the
consumers
,
who
come
in
contact
with
many
advertisements
in
their
life
and
is
eventually
conditioned
,
to
make
the   -   ArtOrDet
decisions
.

the
british
engineering
consultancy

had
found
that
there

so
the
very-high-temperature-reactor
(

is
believed
to
play
an
important
role
in
america
's
energy
crisis
,
because

dependence

because

for

the

armed

(

are
currently
undergoing
transition
to
a
3rd

(

,
they

which
will
be

and
execute

at

.

as
it
takes
years
for
the
country
to
overcome
with   -   Prep
this
problem

so
likewise
spending
on

be
limited

this
argument
goes
on
to
assert
that
because
the
expenditure
of
time
and
money
on
caring
as
well
as
buying
medicine
for
the
elderly
is
enormous
,
public
spending
on
the

will
help
young
people
concentrate
more
on

and
improve

quality
of

in

,

of   -   Um
a   -   Um

is
undeniably
good   desirable   Wci
as
it
makes

administrative

are
greatly
reduced
,
and
the
patient
's
vital
records
-   the   ArtOrDet
,
for
example
drug
allergies
are
readily
retrievable
.

in
-   the   ArtOrDet
year
2000
,
seven
percent
of
singapore
's
total
population
is   was   Vt
over
the

of

,
however   but   Srun
,   but   Srun
by

this
will
increase
to
nineteen

(

.

hence
,

as   for additional health care   Wci
extra   for additional health care   Wci
health   for additional health care   Wci
diagnostic   for additional health care   Wci
may
not
be
necessary
for

people
.

for
the
cpf
contribution
,
the
government
might
set
up
a
regulation
that
-   requires   V0
individuals
-   who   Ssub
reach
a
certain
age
should   to   Wci
start
working

.

however
-   ,   Mec
some
policies
may
not
only
bring
positivity
.

this
is
expected
to
reach
20
%
in
2030
(

.

the
focus
is
to
decrease
the
emission
of
radiation
and
insure   ensure   Wci
the
safety
of
civilians
once
-   an   ArtOrDet
accident
happen   happens   SVA
.

wondering
how
all
these
-   are   V0
connected
with
innovations
?

however
,
by
not
sharing
the
information
,
they
are
posing
a
danger
to
their
family
members
potentially
at
risk
of
carrying
-   ,   Cit
the
disease
.

social   A social   ArtOrDet
need
often
has
to
be
addressed
by
engineers
to   -   Rloc-
fulfill   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
market   -   Rloc-
requirements   -   Rloc-
.

sharing
of
test
positive
result   results   Nn
with
relatives
is
necessary
as
it
is
the
relatives
'
rights   right   Nn
to
know
about
it
.

however
,
i
believe
that
previews
of
the
nuclear
reactors
should
not
influence
the
decision
to
fund
the
research
and
development
of
the
generation
iv
reactors
as   -   ArtOrDet
people
will
be
more
careful
not
to
let
the
same
incidents
happen
again
with
the
advancement
in
technology
.

secondly   In addition   Wci
,
the
public
money
comes
from
taxing
the
workforce
.

therefore
,
it
would
be
more
appropriate
now
if
the
engineer
design
process
moves
toward
human
health
,
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
terms
of
biomedical
invention
such
as
artificial
heart
devices
.

an
appropriate
example
would
be
the
toshiba
laptop
-   received   V0
.

this
is
to
ensure
that
people
will
not
face
financial
problem   problems   Nn
when
they
retire
.

another
reason
is
that
limiting
public
spending
may
arouse
the   complaints from the   Wci
complaints   complaints from the   Wci
of   complaints from the   Wci
public
,
which
in
return
,
has
an
effect
on
the
development
of
the
country
.

from
the
late
19th
to
early
20th   -   Rloc-
century
,
there
was
an
outburst
of
great
discoveries
and
inventions
,
coupled
with
worldwide
expansion
of
industrialisation
,
creating
many
machines
to
aid
human
needs
,
and
wants
.

with
no
limits
set
on
the
expenditure
of
welfare
for
the
aged
,
a
country
with   -   Rloc-
an   -   Rloc-
aging   -   Rloc-
society   -   Rloc-
will
face
enormous
financial
burdens
with   in   Wci
regards   in   Wci
to   in   Wci
the
funding
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
public
pension
system
,
expensive
healthcare
system
and
long-term
dependency
expenditures
.

another
significant
improvement
is
the
appearance
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
electronic
dictronary
.

hence
the
government
should
also
divert
some
of
the   its   Pref
resources
to
improve   improving   Vform
the
lives
of
these   the aged   Pref
people   the aged   Pref

as   for example   Trans
subsidies   by providing subsidies for having children   Wci
for   by providing subsidies for having children   Wci
birth-giving   by providing subsidies for having children   Wci
,   by providing subsidies for having children   Wci
which
not
only
reduces
the
cost
burden   -   Rloc-
of
having
a
child
but
also
encourages
people
to
have
more
children
,
thus
increasing
the
replacement
rate
.

if
the
sick   injured   Wci
do
not
recover
completely
,
it
is
likely
for
him
to
get
injured
again
at
the
same
place
.

the
singapore
government
will
be   provide   Vt
providing   provide   Vt
subsidy   subsidies   Nn
for
all
the
elderly
when
they
seek
for
medical
advancement   treatment   Wci
.

certainly
,
when
the
number
of
aged
people
raises   rises   Wci
,
public
spending
on
this
group
will
have
to
be
raised
as
well
to
take
care
of
this
group
.

however
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
adjustments
to
the
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
policies
have
reduced
the
burden
of
the
country
by
providing
some
of
the
fund   funds   Nn
for
the
elderly
in
their
golden
years
.

although
we
should
never
forget
the
painful
lessons
of
chernobyl
and
three
mile
island
,
we
should
also
be
open-minded
about
the
possibilities
that
generation
iv
nuclear
reactors
brings   bring   SVA
.

millions
and
billions
-   of   Others
dollars
will
have
to
spend   be spent   Vt
to
build
a
nuclear
power
plant
.

such
financial
and
social
problems
would
actually
not
be
faced
by
the
individual   individuals   Nn
and
families   their   Pref
.

if
one
has
no
control
over
who
can
gain
information
of
the
individual
,
it
can
lead
to
potentially
serious
consequences   disorders   Nn

many
people
argue
that
psychology
is
non-related
with
engineering
design
;
companies
do
not
need
to
spend
extra
money
on
the
unnecessary
outcome
.

moreover
,
the
in-laws
,
usually
the
more
traditional
type
,
may
be
dissatisfied
with
the
daughter-in-law
-   for   Wci
not
being
able
to
produce
a
'perfect

,
or
-   being unable to   WOinc
produce
any
offspring
at
all
,
to
sustain
the
future
generation
of
a
family
.

as
far
as
we
would
like
to
help
the
aged
,
there
should
be   give preference   Others
limits
to
which
how
we
can
help
,
such
that
the
still
mentally-competent
or
physically-competent
aged
will
not
be
reliant
on
us
unreservedly
.

recent
research
indeed
shows
that
the
sun
is
a   -   Um
variable
source
of
energy
.

thus
,
this
not
only
benefits
the
elders
,
it
also   the country 's   Others
benefits
the
general
public
as
a
whole
.

however
,
there
is
a   elderly   Wform
risk
involved
to
limiting
spending
on
the
aged
.

this

major

innovational
process
of

in
china
and
their
impact
on
certain   a particular   ArtOrDet
stage
of

process
.

if
they
are
positive
,
they
can
undertake
a
further
diagnostic
procedure
for   to determine   Wci
whether
any
physical
symptom
developing   will developg   Vform
.

even
though
the
safety
of
sodium-cooled
fast
reactor
may
be
better
than
-   that of   Spar
the
gas-cooled
fast
reactor
,
it
can
not
change
the
fact
that
the

is
better
than
the
sodium-cooled

in   at the present stage   Wci

,
because
there
is
still
no
way
to
make
the
nuclear
power
totally
safe
by   -   Prep
now
.

this
is
because
firstly
,
the
stressful
social
environment
that
forces
couples
to
put
their
time
and
effort
in
their   by   Wci
work
,
so
that
they
are
unable
to
spend

therefore
,
to
have

such
as
having
sufficient
social
support
and
having
an
active
engagement
in

helps
people   the elderly   Wci

as
for
the
other
incident   accident   Wci
which
happened
in
chernobyl
,
it
was
a
result
of
operators
,
who
were
not
well
trained
in
operation
and
safety
,
operating
on
a
reactor
which
is   was   Vt
inadequately

however
,
even

there

,
the
greenhouse

still
exist

depleting

.

in
conclusion
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
result
of
genetic
testing
should
be
revealed
without
the
consent
of
the
person
who
requested
it
as
this
would
not
only
enable
-   a   ArtOrDet
third
party
to
get
early
prevention
or
treatment
but
also
help
others
to
make
life
decisions
.

power   The power   ArtOrDet
output
of
this

is

and   -   Um
can   -   Um
do   -   Um

.

as
such
,
governments
were
pushed
to
invest
resources
,
especially
in   -   Rloc-
terms   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
monetary
to
solve
problems
such   . These may include   Srun

having

-   a   ArtOrDet
scheme
to

and

on
the

.

despite
taking
the
risks
of
catching
a
disease
,
the
client
should
as   -   Rloc-
well   -   Rloc-
own
the
right
to
buy
the
insurance
.

selecting   selection   Vform
of
solutions
to
any
of
the
problems
will
probably

the
most
difficult
stage
in

if
someone   some   Wform
kept
the   their disease a   Wci
secret
until

,
we
will   would not have known   Vt
not   would not have known   Vt

that
it
will   posed   Wci
conduct   posed   Wci
a
serious
problem
to

.

in
summary
,
the
flow
of
the
design
process
can
be
-   of   Wci
hampered
by
the
lack
of
funds
and
knowledge
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
cut
down
,
because
the
younger
generation
should
be
the
one
supporting
their
parents
,
it
is
their
own
duty
and
should
not
be
left
to
the
government
.

firstly
,
the
use
of
surveillance

technology
threatens
our
human
right

whereas   In comparison ,   Trans
for   the MSR   Rloc-

msr   the MSR   Rloc-
it   the MSR   Rloc-
is
considered
a

choice
as
it
is
safer
to

and

.

after
the
invention
is
patented
,
there
is
nobody
who
is
willing
to
buy
it
,   -   Mec
because
in
indonesia
's

it
's   is   Wtone
not
cost
efficient
.

first
of
all
,
we   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
engineers
have
to
fabricate
products
which
combat
with   -   Prep
blindness
,
also   -   Rloc-
user-friendly   that are user- friendly   Others
and
low

this
will

areas
to

in

as

the   Therefore , the   Trans
governments
should
invest
on   in   Prep
other
areas
so
that
the
development
of
the
country
will
ultimately
resolve
the

.

when
using
rfid
for

for
finding
crime   criminals   Wform
,
for

,
the
official

you   will   Wci
have
to

there
is
a
debate
on
whether
the

hence

the

loses
its
value
,
it
will
be
forgotten
from   -   Rloc-
our   -   Rloc-
sight   -   Rloc-
.

however
,
the
problem
is
basically
that
people
only
make
changes
according   -   Rloc-
to
the
traditional
system
,
while
in
most
cases
a
better
system
has
to
be
built
with
the
old
one
totally
destroyed
.

this
act
came
into
force
in
1995
to
give
parents
above   into   Prep
60
years

who
could
not
support
themselves
the
legal
means
to
claim
maintenance
from
their
children
.

through
research
and   of   Vt
development
,
it
is
said
that
the

should
support

we   For example , we   Trans
can
not

the

of

education

on
the
other
hand
,
since

people   the aged   Others
are
mostly
more
experienced
and
patient
,
there
truly
exist
some
certain   -   Rloc-

more
suitable
for
them
.

firstly
,
the
goal
of
personal
health
technologies
will
be
to
change
from
a
centralized
model
where
the
elderly
would
go
to
the
hospital
where

is

to
a
distributed
model
where   whereby   Trans

,
the
oil

increased

$
15.77/bbl
in

to

91.35/bbl
in

.

even
though
these
two
kinds
of
technology
develop   are developed   V0
from   in   Prep
different
ways
,
they
both
can
benefit
-   the   ArtOrDet
society
and
our

life
.

it
was
an
improvement
,
albeit
a
small
one
.

however
,
there
remains
doubt
on   of   Prep
the
safety
of

in

the

thus

should
use

to
handle

thus
,
the
-   the   ArtOrDet
individual
should
not
be
obligated
to
tell
his

.

instead
of
increasing
spending
on

,
the
problem
can
also
be
tackled
by
encouraging
elder   the elderly   Others

the

,
nuclear
reactors
have
its   their   Pref
own
advantages
on
both
cost
and
performance
.

one
such
reactor
that
we
could
see
in
the
near
future
is
the
very-high-temperature-reactor
(
vhtr
)
,
which
allows
for
more
efficient
conversion
of
heat
to
electricity
,
up
to
more
than   remember   Vt
half
of
what
could
be
produced
previously
.

we
should
be
responsible
and
with
these
values
and
beliefs
,
there
is
no
dilemma
because
subjecting   being subjected to   Vform
to
discrimination
and
other
social
problems
are   is   SVA
insignificant
when
compared
to
matters
of
live   life   Mec
and
death
and
health
of
the
general
public
.

the
second
step
of
this   decision-making   Mec
engineering
design
process
is
to
gather
essential
information
.

to   The   ArtOrDet
do   The   ArtOrDet
this   The   ArtOrDet
concept
of

system
is
to
let
the   -   ArtOrDet
fuel
fully

in
order
to
save
the   it   Pref
fuel   it   Pref
.

in
2001
,
the
generation
iv
international
forum
has   -   Vt
introduced
six
different
generation
iv
nuclear
reactor
concepts
which
have   had   Vt
been
designed
in
such
a
way
that
when
accidents
occur
,
the
damage
will
be
contained
(
butler
,
2004
)
.

over
the
years
,
the
expenditure
on
the
aged
has
relatively
increased
due
to
the   a   ArtOrDet
shift
to   towards   Prep
an
aging
population
.

the
testing
stage
is
usually
either
the
most
rewarding
or
-   the most   Spar
heart-
breaking
stage
of
a
design
process
.

this
would
translate   mean   Wci
to   mean   Wci
higher
costs
of
living
for
the
aged
.

lastly
,
the
use
of
surveillance   surveillance   Mec
technology
can
be
abused
by
the
government
and
or
any
agency
that
used   uses   Vt
it
.

however
,
generation
iv
reactor   reactors   Nn
such
as

vhtr
has   have   SVA
advanced
safety
mechanism   mechanisms   Nn
which
will
minimize
the
probability
of
accidents
occurring
.

recent
researches   research studies   Wci
have
shown
that
the
proportion
of
the
country
's
residents
aged
65
and
above
can
reach
the
number   rate   Wci
of
18.7
%
in
the
next
20
years
.

the
worst
thing
when   -   Rloc-
nuclear   -   Rloc-
reactor   -   Rloc-
like   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
nuclear   -   Rloc-
bomb   -   Rloc-
was
not
the
immediate
death
but
the
exposure
of
human   humans   Nn
to
radiation
.

with
the
development
of
various
policies
and
strategies
,
leaders   strategy   Nn
must
understand
that
the
best
strategy
is
one
where
everyone
unites
together
in
conquering
the
long
term
battle
of
global
aging
.

with
this
development
,
the
modern
cng
vehicle
became
possible
.

it
is
clear
governments
should
fund
the
vhtr
nuclear
projects   reactors   Nn
to
develop
it
further
,
and
nuclear
energy
will
definitely
be
the
energy
of
the
future
.

also   Moreover ,   Trans
if
someone
has   receives   Vt
received   receives   Vt
a
negative
response
,
there
is
a
high
chance
that
they   he   Pref
will
not
pursue
any
innovative
attempts
anymore
.

thus
,
it
seems
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
information
technology
does
not
help
the
adults
a
lot
.

moreover
,
the
elderly
usually
demand
high   higher   Wform
salary
in
exchange
for
their
experience
but
they
can
not
work
as
hard
as
when
they
was   were   SVA
young
,
whereas
the
young
lack
experience
and
find
difficulty
in
seeking
jobs
.

hence
,
if
chinese
scientists
and
engineers
work
like   as   SVA
a
team
,
the
efficiency
of
work
will
be
improved
and
the
period
of
work
time
will
be
less
.

last
of
all
,
one
of
the
most
promising
and
nerve-racking
reasons
would   is   Vt
be   is   Vt
the
risk
of
development
of
nuclear
weapons
in
an
era
of
transnational
terrorism

the
singapore
government
has

implemented
policies
which
have
helped
to
solve

arising
from

to
a
large

in

it

but
we
can
claim
that
such

not

in

,
according
to
the

(
2009
)
,
there   -   Rloc-

about

and

in

many
people
think
that
comparing   compared   Wform
with
traditional
ways
of
producing
electricity
,
using
nuclear
reactor   reactors   Nn
is
not
safe
.

there
are
two
major
safety
problems
of
building
nuclear
plants
.

there
will
not
be
the
problem
of
terrorism
due
to   sources   Nn
stolen

or
induced
accidents
in
nuclear
power
plants
.

a
good

without

will
not
fetch   -   Um
them   -   Um
.

for
this
group
of
people
,
most
governments
intervene
to
help
to   -   Rloc-
subsidise
for   -   Prep
treatments
they
genuinely
need
.

in
this
case
,
they
might
encounter
difficulties
in
paying
for
the
medical
fees
as
they
have
more
than
one
elderly
-   person   Nn
to
look
after
.

this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
marketing
strategies
such
as
the
use
of
promotions
and
advertisements
is
extremely
important
in
rising   raising   Vform
the
awareness
and
creating
a
need
for
new
technologies
,
thus
allowing
a
new
technology
to
survive
.

there
has
been
a
debate
between
two
generation
four
reactorsthe   reactors , the   Mec
very
high
temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
and
the
supercritical
water
reactor
(

superior

.

thus
,
those
elderly
who
have
subsequently
used
up
their
funds
will
then
seek
for   -   Prep
financial
help
.

however
,
legislation
is
already
in
place
-   at   Wci
national
level
and
data
protection
authorities
have
been
established
to
safeguard
the
unauthorized

of

(
rfid

,
n.d.
)
.

the
next

is   was   Vt
to

the
scientific
method
to
fulfill
the
previous
target
.

thus
,
the
opportunity
cost
to
invest
in
the
education
is
lower
than
to
invest
on
the
elderly
.

furthermore
there
is
none
or
simply
only
a
few
research
laboratories
-   that   Pref
are
set
up
in   on   Prep
campus
to
encourage
undergraduates
to
determine

themselves   -   Um
during

for
example
,
further
development
of
electric
cars
was   sold   Vt
dismissed
due
to
the
shift
of
taste
of
the
market
towards
the
``
hybrid
''
gas-
and-electric-powered
vehicles
.

so
,
when
other
family
members
or
relatives
is   are   SVA
tested
positive
for
the
disorder
or
disease
,
at
least
they
know
that
they
are
not
alone
and
they
could
rely
on
the
support
group
for
any
advices   advice   Nn
or
any
moral
or
emotional
support
from
them
.

as
each
year
passes
,
there
seems
to
be
an
increase
on
public
spending
towards
the
aged
.

however
,
67
%
of
the
elderly
in
singapore
is
illiterate
and
is
only
proficient
in
non-mandarin   non-Mandarin   Mec
dialects
.   -   Rloc-

moreover
having
in
place
all
the
amenities
for
the
elderly
,
it
would
allow
the
elderly
to
be
more
independent
and   -   Rloc-
less   -   Rloc-

in
taking

nowadays

in

this

and
thus
it

true
to
say
that

have

the

the

and
because

since

many

it

there

from

furthermore

with

if

nowadays

the
first
point
needed
to
be

is
how

we
do
not
maintain
a

that
caters

no

how

the

the

in

what

do
is
not

therefore

this

in
conclusion
,
public
spending
on
the

be
limited
so
that

could
be
used
in

in
terms
of

the

decided
to

and
support

along

in
the
case

the

this

according
to
a
survey
published
by
-   the   ArtOrDet
institute
of
service

(

last

singapore

in

;   .   Mec
one   One   Mec
of
the
reasons
is
the
ease
of
foreign

here
.

the
current
nuclear

plants
use

ii

,
for
example
,
pressurized

boiling

as
the
world
goes
on
,
technology
has
been
applied
to
public
transportation
in
the
development
of
intelligent

system
(
its
)
that
enhance
older

mobility
by
providing

since   This is because   Trans
these
results
will
affect
not
only
the
individual
,
but
also
his
family
,
offspring
,
the
future
generations
and
even
the
society
.

therefore
a
portion
of
public
spending
should
be
place   given   Wci
to
align   -   Um

and
skills

relevant
to
the
needs
of
the

.

furthermore
more
and
more
countries
are
compelled
by
the
law
to
set
aside
certain
amount
of
money
for
their
old
age
.

secondly

a
general
perception
from
the
public
that
the
cost
incurred
to

a

is
always
huge
.

although
the
possibility

the

of
energy
that

environmental

and   . The   Srun

this
mission
not

lies
on

hands

also
require
some
supports   support   Vform
from

therefore
,
there
is
not   no   Wci
a   no   Wci
need
to

as
individuals
can
ask
their

relative   relatives   Nn
to
undergo
genetic
testing
without
revealing
their
result
.

in
conclusion
,
public
spending   do   SVA
should
not
be
limited
and
divert
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
in
order
to
make

into

well
,
improvement
on
the
transportation
not
only
helps
the
elderly
,
it
also
encourages
the
public
to
use
the
public
transport
which
reduce   reduces   SVA
pollution
as
well
as
traffic
jams
and
older
people
are
wiser
in
the
sense
that
they
are
more
experienced
compare   compared   Vform
to
the
naïve
and
impatient
younger
generation
.

one
similarity
the
two
technologies
share
is
that
the
process
is
tough
.

firstly
,
education
is
one   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
most   -   Rloc-
important
aspects   -   Um
in
singapore
as
it
secures
the
future
of
the
younger
generation
.

it
is
usually
used
in   developing   Vform
a
problem-solving
works
for
design
problems
.

in
this
case
,
third
parties
such
as
doctors
should
not
reveal
-   the results   Others
,
as
doctors
are
usually
more
concerned
of   with   Prep
alerting
the
person
of
the
possible
chances
of
contracting
the
genetic
disease
,
rather
than
the
possible
negative
impacts
this
news
may
bring
to
the
person
.

the
failure
of
disclosure
of
genetics
test
results
frequently
cause
relatives
to
be
enraged
and
upset
,
and
this
had
lead
to
numerous
lawsuits
against
the
genetics
provider
,
as
they
felt
that
it
should
be
these
genetic
providers
'
responsibilities
to
inform
them
,
but
in
fact   dilemmadil   Rloc-
is
the
responsibility
of
the
person
being
tested
(

.

note

secondly
-   ,   Mec
government
expenditure
is
needed
to
expand
and
maintain
-   the   ArtOrDet
economic
structure
.

furthermore
,
their
family
members
are
granted
the
time
to
equip
themselves
with
the
knowledge
and
ability   -   Rloc-
to
take
care
of
said
patients
for
an
extended
period
of
time
in
future
.

secondly
,
the   fuel   Nn
molten
salt
reactor
is
highly
effective
and
efficient
.

in
conventional
nuclear
reactors
,
the
radioactive
fission
products
remain
in
the
reactor
core
-   the   ArtOrDet
.

thus
detrimental
effects
on
both
parties
can
be
seen
due
to
the
failure
of
disclosing
genetic
test
results
to
relatives
.

in
addition
to
the
problem
of
leadership
in
state-run
entrepreneurs   enterprises   Wci
,
the
problem
created
by
the
monopolistic
status
of
state-run
entrepreneurs   enterprises   Wci
also
can
not
be
neglected
.

this

furthermore
,
with
the

medical
field
,
many
medical
procedures
have
been
simplified
from

needless

the
major
refutation

is
about
its
threat
to
the
safety
of
the   -   Rloc-

since
conventional
nuclear

produces
radioactive

and
has
a

in
this

,
less

is
involved

however
,

it

to
choose

instead
of

despite

the

the

the

fortunately

these   These   Mec

hence
,
the
individual
-   an   ArtOrDet
requesting
genetic

should
have
the

say

to

the

secondly
,
the   nuclear   Mec
amount
of
radioactive

emitted
by

is
also
harmful
to

,
and
yet
,
these

release

the

so
the
cost
of
running
a

will
not
be
as
high
as
other

in
the
long
run
.

in
fact
,
the
overall

of
the

is
more

50

whereas   -   Rloc-

nowadays

therefore

the

this

so   Thus ,   Trans
the

when

this
is
a

as
it
is
the
point
where
we
will
be
able
to
come
out   up   Wci
with

higher

however   For   Wci

it

if
the

continues
to

,
pertinent

will

escalate
.

it
follows
that
we
often
heard   hear   Vt
-   that   SVA
the

living
in

.

i   Therefore ,   Wtone
feel   Therefore ,   Wtone
that   Therefore ,   Wtone
public

because
the

aging

has
become
a
major
problem
in
the

.

who

have
thought
that
an

would

for

all

to

yet
,
in
the
first

,
spending

may
not
be
a
good
way
to

societal
issues
such
as
the
lack

amongst
-   the   ArtOrDet
youth
and
over
dependence
on

to
solve
every
problem
one
might
face
with

this
will
help
the

indirectly
as
the
children
are
trained
-   a   ArtOrDet
to
embrace
the
eastern
value
to
respect
and
taking

their

furthermore

there

key
areas

compared

the

with
the

,
it
will
be

for

these

an

that

this

secondly

by

the

this
can
be

the

since

are
non

and
emit
so   a lot of   Wci
much   a lot of   Wci

the

in
the
event
that
the
government
's
expenditure
on
the
aged
is
restricted
while
the
number
of

is
surging
,
the
needs
of

may
not
be
completely

.

therefore

with

many

further

however

the
increase

the   in   Wci
efficiency
will   -   Vt
bring   -   Vt
more

to
the

and
therefore
the
government
can
spare
more
money
on   for   Prep
the

.

another
solution
is
the
perpetual
resources
as   -   Rloc-
known
as
solar
,
geothermal

and   ,   Mec
etc
...   .   Mec
the

currently
,
there
are
only

the
diminishing
of
economic
productivity
due
to

may
have
an
abysmal
effect
on
a
country

.

the
railway
track
used

is
not

in

,
it
also
decreases
the
slight
discrepancy

due

the

more
public

on

firstly
,
the
older

is
not
spending
a
large
proportion
of
the
country
's

,
and
the
fact
is
not

that
the
relatively   -   Rloc-

the

government   The government   ArtOrDet

nonetheless
,
current

preeminently
help

dire
consequences

a

the

with

it
will
make

secondly   The second   Wci

the

was
brought
up
when
deciding
if

might
surface
when
the

in

the

less
than

not

that

,
the
biggest
problem
is
they

have
no

however
,
in

,
the

increase

but
this
difference
does

decrease
the

for
example
,

suffering
from

should
be
given
more

than
an

without

opponents
of
this
position
argued
that

one

that

there

this

not

to

for
instance
,
a

another
reason
why

the

the

with

first
of

,
there
should
be
a

equipped
with
the   -   ArtOrDet

efficiency
,
all
the
innovations
of
engineering
technology
will
be
more
dynamic
and
practical
to
meet
our   the country 's   Wtone
ever-increasing
needs
.

besides
giving
financial
aid
to
r
&
d
departments
which
helps
to
initiate
the

of
the

on
electric

,

quite   However   Trans

,
while
there
is
a
highly
increasing
demand
in   for   Prep
engineers
with
acuity
of
design
,
even
in
the
education
system
of
my
own
country
,
there
are
two
major
setbacks
for
engineering
students
getting
adequate
design
skills
:
the
lack
of
practice
in
school
and
the
insufficiency
of
co-curricular
activities
.

in
comparison
to
other
alternative   -   Rloc-
hydrogen
producing
methods
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
vhtr
produces
hydrogen
at
a
lower
costs   cost   Nn
.

so
let
us
take
chernobyl
as
an
example
,
and
have
an
insight
of
this   had   Wci
nuclear
industrial
accident
.

as
discussed
earlier
on   -   Rloc-
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
rising
healthcare
costs
coupled
with
longer
living
parents
put   puts   SVA
pressure
on
their   -   Pref
cash-strapped
children
to
provide
for
their
elderly
parents
.

the   -   ArtOrDet
-   Money saved from   Others
reduced
spending
on
the
aged
can
then
be
invested
in
other
areas
for
instance
education
.

after
that
,
engineering
design
process
applies
the
engineering
theorem
and
latest
technology
to
practice
,
which   and this is equivalent to using solar energy effectively..   Srun

to
ease
the
aging
process
,
governments
had   have to   Vt
put
-   in   Prep
a
great
effort
in
-   the   ArtOrDet
research
of
medicine
to
provide
the
best
treatment
to   for   Prep
the
aged
.

in
any   -   ArtOrDet
case
of
-   an   SVA
industrial
accident
in
one
of
the
system   systems   SVA
,
operators
can
easily
isolate
that
particular
system
and
rectify
the
problem
as
quickly
as
possible
without
worrying
that
the
problem
might
spread
to
other   -   Mec
parts
of
the
other
two
systems
.

therefore
,
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
should
be
obligated
to   himself or herself   Pref
tell
his
or
her
relatives
for
the
betterment
of
the
relatives
to
take
preventive
measures
and
also
be
equipped
with
related
knowledge
to
save
their
own
lives
.

in
fact
,
the
chernobyl
accident
arises   arose   Vt
from
-   a   ArtOrDet
chain
of
human
errors
.

a
good
illustration
was
the
failure

thus
,
in
order
to
ease
this
issue
faced
by
the
aged
,
the
government
raises   has raised   Vt
the
retirement
age
beyond
62
and
introduces   introduced   Vt
various
schemes

this
paper
recommends
that
public
spending
on
the
elderly
should   for   Prep
not
be
limited
so
that
money
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country

development
.

despite
the
negative
points
of
the
vhtr
,
it
is
still
way
ahead
of
the
msr
and
all
other
generation
iv
models
,
-   as   Srun
only

secondly
,
the
financial

some
may
argue
that
these

keep

tracking
their
health

in

thus
,
the
policy
has
a   -   ArtOrDet
minimal
effect
and
does
not
address
the

besides
,
if

problems

another

problem

therefore   benefit   Wform
,
despite
the
benefits
economic
growth
could
bring
to
the
elderly
,
it
is
still
necessary
to
set
aside
a
portion
of
the
government
spending
for
the
elderly
as
a
safeguard
to
protect
their
basic
interests
and
not
only
to
rely
on
the
revenue
earned
to
help
the

there
are
-   ,   Mec
however
,
concerns
about
nuclear
power
with
respect

its
safety
,
economic
viability
and
waste
disposal
.

mainly   This was mainly ...   Others
due
to
the
fact
that
not

during

and
the
effects
of
burying

is   are   SVA
yet
to

for
the
case

the

admitted

therefore

in

to
ensure
that
older

not

according
to
andrew

,
a
former
member
of

committee
for

management
(

,
which
advised
the

the

not

will
last

lastly
,

the
impending

factor

regarded
as
insignificant

these
elderly
were
once
the
people
who
had   -   Vt
helped
in

the
government
should
show
their
compassion
and
care
for
this
vulnerable

by
not
restricting
public

however

it

furthermore

this
is
an

however

every

we   people   Wtone
should
think
twice
before
giving
such
an   -   Wtone
offensive   -   Wtone

proponents
for
the

assert
that

since

for
example
,
in

some

lastly

in
the
area

not

it

thus
more
should
be

that
there
is
not

as
of
such
,
they
often
resort
to
using

now

as

we

but
i
consider
psychology
as
the
requisite
factor
for

work

for
example
,
in
singapore
,
the
high

actually

there

due

an

if
the

unrestricted
,
the
coming
wave
of
retiring
baby

may
wash
away
projected

it
is
not

that
the

has   have   Vt
problems

it

by

this
is
because

not
be

and
minor

important
changes

although
incentives
are
given
to
companies
who
hire
local

the
upgrading
of

of
the

has
been
done
as
well

to
be
