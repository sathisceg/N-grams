the
life
expectancy
of
individuals
has
increased
due
to
better   Prep
accessibility
to
healthcare
services
and
facilities
than
before

in
addition
,
a
better
health
care
system
will
allow
the
people
to
stay   Wci
healthier
and
prevent
some
major
illness
from
happening
like
stroke
and
heart
attack

one
cause
for
this
is
attributed
to
the
era
of
baby   Rloc-
boomers
,
who
are
now
mostly
in
their
late
fifties
or
early
sixties

before
this
solution
was
implemented
,
they
did
a
further
study
,
and
realized
that
the
solution
will
not
work
;
as
the
farmers
are
using
traditional   Rloc-
farming
methods
which
are
not
yield
efficient

due
to
these
problems
,
a
team
of
researchers
have
created
a
system
that
makes
use
of
sensors
to
identify
human
actions
and
uses   Rloc-
mobile
devices
to
remind
the
elderly
to
perform
daily
activities

if
the
fertility
rate
continues
to
drop
,
there
will
be
not
-
enough   Vt
young
people
to
replace
the
older
generation

some
people
argue
that
welfare
of
the
aged
is
a
full
responsibility
of
the
government
as
they
have
contributed
to
the
society
for
many
years
and
it
is
a
way
of
showing   Wci
appreciation
to
them

with
the
mission   Wci
'better
jobs
for
life
'
,
this
institute
is
to
provide
help
to
the
workforce

as
the
development
of
technology
,
the
abilities
of
innovation
have
becoming
more
and
more
important
all   SVA
over
the
world

the
rewarding
of
the
elderly
does
not
push
the
country
forward
,
whereas
it
is
the
upbringing
of
our   Prep
youth
that
will
ensure
a
future
for
our   Prep
country

hence
,
the
individual
should
bear
in
mind
the
impacts
that
may   Prep
arise
and
decide
if
they
should
reveal
such
results

thus
in
the
next
few   Vt
paragraphs
,
i
will
explain
in
depth
on
the
various
research
and
government
policies
being
developed
has
help
to
ease
the
aging
process

we
are
not
only   Cit
concerning
the
shortage
of
technology
but
also
considering
the
danger
of
terrorists

besides
that
,
the
burden
to
take
care
of
the
graying
generation
will
also
be
shared
by
the
children
of
the
elderly
people
-
who
will
be
highly
educated
-
to
find
jobs   Nn
easily
to
support
their
families

therefore
,
they
may
get
even
more
money
for
their   SVA
own
-
than
receiving
-
from
the
government
's
welfare

the
parties   Nn
involved
take
pride
in
their
work

the
safety
of
-
scwr
has
been   Nn
proven
and
can
be
better
in
the
future

thus
,
compulsory   Wci
saving
can
help
guarantee
a
sizable
amount
of
saving
for
their
future
and
is
a
practical
and
effective
way
to
ensure
old
age
dependency
is
-
kept
to
the
minimum

in
another
word
,
if
one
was
tagged
,
he
risked
being
permanently   Wci
marked
for
life
due
to
the
difficulty
of
removing
the
chip

yes
,
they
are
right
,
but
they
are
just
comparing   Um
swcr
with
the
generation
iii
reactors
,
not
-
gfr
reactor

for
instance
,
if
our
health
insurance   Rloc-
belongs
to
an
individual
for
earning
purpose
we
should
pay
a
lot
more
to
see
a
doctor
and
get
a
prescription
and
this
makes
the
old
feel
difficult
as
they
can
not
earn
more
after
retirement
but
have
to
visit
hospital
more
frequently
than
before
as
peterson
(
2001
)
said

fund
is
an
important
factor
that
determines   Nn
whether
the
design
process
can
be
carry
on
or
otherwise

in
recent
years
,
modifications
in
architectures
have
been
made
to
ensure   Prep
elders
'
safety

it
is
the
fact
that
sound   Wci
travels
through
matter
as
vibrations

therefore
,
we
can
say
that
limitation
on
spending
for
the
aged
is
a
good
idea
since
in
indonesia
,
there
is
still
many
areas
that
are
not
well
developed
yet
-
especially
in
-
economic   Vform
area

if
a
technology
can
not
apply
well   Prep
enough
,
it
can
not
develop

some
of
them
are
encouraging   Nn
later
retirement
,
raising
more
productive
children
,
encouraging   Nn
the
elderly
and
their
families
to
take
more
responsibility
for
their
health
,
etc

it
reduces
the
probability
of
making   Wform
mistakes
and
level
of
seriousness
of
accidents

on
the
contrary
,
people
often   Nn
question
the
effectiveness
of
these
initiatives

experiments
and   Npos
tests
are
not
to
be
omitted
in
laboratories

besides
this
,
remote
controlled
lighting
helps
-
elderly
to
control
the
house   Rloc-
lights
with
a
remote
control
,
therefore
,
it
minimizes
the
risk
-
falling
in
the
dark

instead
of
treating
the
elderly
in
society
as
an
expense
,
the
government
can
think
of
ways
to
harness
the
knowledge
and
experience
from
them
so
that
they
can
contribute   Nn
back
more
into
society

therefore
,
the
elderly   Pform
have
to
rely
on
the
government

thirdly
,
engineering   Trans
consists
of
electrical
,
chemical
,
computer
,
radiology
,
nuclear
and
mechanical
-

with
rising
oil   Rloc-
prices
and
growing
concerns
of
global
warming
,
countries
are
looking
to
nuclear
power
to
solve
the
energy
needs
of
tomorrow

a
person
's
well
being
in
many
ways
,
with
both
psychological
and
physical
changes
,
including   Wci
chronic
diseases
associated
with
aging

besides
,
the
molten   Wci
salt
reactor
can
solve
these
problems
perfectly

studies
show
that
of
all
people
over   Nn
80
,
20
%
suffers
from
alzheimer
-
(
as
cited
in
health-cares.net
,
2005
)

in
addition
,
this
testing
also
can
be
used
to
determine
a
child
's
biological   Wci
father
or
a
person
's
ancestry

whilst
some
insisted
that
the
disclosure
of
the
results
is
necessary
because
it
leads
to
early
detection
of
a
disease
and
thus
enhances   Wci
preventability
and
treatability

this
is
influenced
by
the
different
social
and
economic
atmospheres   Wci
prevalent

so
it
has
been
a
controversial
issue
that
whether
government
shall   Rloc-
cut
public
spending
on
the
aged
and
divert
-
to
other
areas
of
economic
development

secure

also
,
it
is
necessary   Npos
and
feasible

however
,
i
have
to
say
that
these
people
are
so
short-sighted
that
they
did
not
find
the
fundamental   WOinc
solutions

apart
from
that
,
the
aged
is
also
burdened
by
the
inadequate
funds
in
their
cpf   Nn
accounts
with
several
reasons
for
the
inadequacy

these
are
very
complex   Rloc-
researches
that
could
take
a
long
period
of
time
and
requires
collaboration
with
partners
across
the
world
(

)

they
develop
certain
technology
which
satisfies
certain
consumer
domains
;
in
comparison
,
scientists
usually
do
not
know
the
use
and
the
specific
consumer
domains
when
they
first
accidently   Wci
discover
a
technology

the
second
consequence
is
about
the
genetic
discrimination
,
especially
in
employment
and
insurance
(
norrgard
,
2008
)
.insurance
may
not
be
provided
to
an
individual
with
results
showing
the
possibility
of
getting   Nn
ill

the
original   Wci
goal
of
developing
nuclear
technology
is
to
invent
weapons

it
is
still
remember
that
in
1979
at
three   Wci
mile
island
,
the
reactor
exploded
and
killed
31
at
once
and
spewed
radioactive
across
europe

it
is
hard
to
have
a
new
idea   Nn
pops
out
from
their
minds
as
they
will
not
think
out
of
the
box

the
military   WOinc
aspect
has
contributed
a
lot
to
technology
improvements

nevertheless
,
some
may
argue
that
it
is
to
one
's
``
entitlement
''
to
receive
pension
-
and
other
forms
of
material
benefits
upon
retirement
citation   Wci

the
government
have
also
been
legislating   Wci
laws
that
require
employers
to
offer
re-employment
to
their
workers
until
the
age
of
65.this
is
a
flexible
approach
because
the
workers
do
not
have
to
get
the
same
job
or
pay

once
knowing
the
reasons
,
researchers
can
come
up
with
ideas
of
how
to
slow   Nn
down
or
even
reverse
the
aging

without
the
proper
understanding
,
people
mostly
-
object
-
engineering
design
,
let   Nn
alone
the
support

indeed
,
for
the
case
of
penicillin
,
fleming   Wci
did
not
anticipate
the
discovery
of
penicillin
,
a
type
of
antibiotics
,
when
he
was
making
researches
on
the
characteristics
of
bacteria

secondly
,
critics
argue
that
the
vhtr
is
too
costly
and
it
will
ultimately
be
eliminated
in
the
future
due
to
economic
factors
-
just
as
what
happened
to
the
htgr
or
high-temperature-gas-reactor
in
1989
(
international   Vt
atomic
energy
agency
,
n.d
)

this
is
due
to
the
nature
of
molten   Wci
fluoride
salts
,
which
is
used
as
coolant
and
is
mechanically
and
chemically
stable
at
sea-level
pressures
(
forsberg
2004
)

after
all
,
not
only
the
young   Cit
but
the
old
people
will
also
benefit
from
the
investment
on
education

however
,
singaporeans
still
enjoy
heavy   Rloc-
subsidies
in
public
hospital
,
especially
in
the
lower
class
wards

one
of
the
policies
is
the
housing
policy
,
which
strongly   Rloc-
encourages
extended
family
by
providing
incentives
and
also
to
provide
the
'elder-
friendly
housing
'
for
the
senior
citizens

so
,
the
grown
children
should
continue
with
such   SVA
tradition

one
of
the
core   Nn
theories
-
is
to
teach
people
to
obey
the
rules
and
regulations

research
are
also
done
on
other
elderly
illnesses
to
find
out
the
most
efficient   Vt
medications

this
will
increase
the
willingness
of
the
grown
children
to
take
care
of
their   SVA
parents
and
realize
their   SVA
obligation
to
their   SVA
parents

we
need
the
right
tools
for
the
right
kind
of
job
,
we
ca   Nn
n't
possibly
use
a
screwdriver
to
do
a
hammer
's
work
,
and
right
now
this
problem
is
being
faced

korea
needs
to
reform
its
national
policies
if
it
hopes
to
create
a
better
and
sustainable
future
society
as
there
will
be
a
lot
of
negative
impacts
to
the
country
-
such
as
-
inevitable
labor
shortage
,
increase
in
public
spending
and
healthcare
problems
if
the
ageing
population
continues
to
grow   Rloc-
disproportionately
with
the
country
's
fertility
rate

early
mobile
phones
were
heavy
,
bulky
and
expensive
with
very
-
low   Vt
coverage

many
of
the
researches
of
engineering
design
which
were
carried
out
in
the
modern
countries
had   Nn
been
done
successfully

(
gen
iv
reactors
,
2009
)
furthermore
,
msr
's
fuel
doubles
up
as
its
coolant
due
to
the
good
heat
transportation   Wci
properties
of
molten
salts
further
reduce
on
the
waste
produced

the
emission
of
harmful   Wci
pollutants
into
the
air
atmosphere
by
motorcars
and
factories
has
affected
human
health
and
this
need
to
be
rectified

this
may
result
in
greater
productivity
among
the
workers
as
they
tend
to
be
more
committed
for
their
work
(
valarie   Wci
tan
,
2009
)

this
also
indicates
a
loss
in
mutual   Wci
trust
within
individuals

these
robots
can
also
play
a
role
in
taking
care
of
the
elderly
in
the
future
for
instance
-
the
wheelchairs
that
operates
using
buttons
can
replace   Nn
humans
pushing
the
wheelchair

although
governments
raise
fund
and
increase
budget
to
support
the
elderly
,
healthcare   Vt
costs
is
still
high
and
some
of
the
treatments
which
apply
new
technologies
and
methods
are
so
expensive
that
money
they
save
will
run
out
after
a
few
days

firstly
,
the
mobility
for
the
elderly
has   Prep
been
improved

for
example
,
a
factory
in
southeast
china
produces
toys
for
a
japanese
company
and
these
toys
are
sold
to
north   Wci
america

with
every   Vt
year
passes
by
,
they
are
facing
the
limitations
of
their
physical
and
mental
strength

despite
this
,
the
crux
of
the
issue
here   Nn
lies
in
how
much
should
this
spending
on
the
aged
be
capped
at

this
is
because
different
people
will
react   Wci
differently
after
knowing
-
individuals
genetic
testing
results

as
a
result
,
the
lack
of
fund
will
hamper
the
progress
of
the
design
process
as
there
is
no
material
to
manufacture
a
physical   ArtOrDet
product
to
test
its
usefulness

throughout
the
years
,
there
has
always
been
a
debate
on
whether
technology
shapes
society
,
a
technologically   Wci
determinist
perspective
,
or
does
society
shape
technology
,
a
socially
determinist
view

spouses
too
have
the
rights
to
know   Nn
when
it
comes
to
making
a
family
just
as
he
or
she
has
equal
rights
over
the
children

other
than
that
,
engineers
will
also
need
to
go
through
the
process
of
``
analysing
-
and
selecting
a
solution
''
to
make
sure
that
the
new
product
is
fairly   Wci
accurate
and
it
will
not
cause
any
health
problem
to
the
user
before
releasing
it
to
the
market

it
has
changed
many
aspects
of
our
lives
and
has
unknowingly
-
penetrated   correct
ubiquitously
into
our
society
making
many
of
us
dependent
on
it

in
summary
,
vhtr
will
solve
the
nuclear
waste
problems
if
it
is
implemented
as
-
a
generation   Vt
iv
reactor

this
reduction
will
no
doubt   Um
cripple
on
the
country
's
economy
,
as
funds
will
have
to
be
used
to
cater
to
the
needs
of
the
older
majority

in
a
few
years
-
time
,
china
's
aviation   Wci
industry
grew
from
small
to
rather
large
and
became
able
to
produce
aircrafts
of
many
kinds

this
included
the
consistent   Wci
functional
review
of
instruments
and
constant
search
question

(

being
a
highly
classified

,

was

(

firstly
,
a
couple
who
is
planning
get
marry
and
one
of
them
or
a
close   Um
relative
of
them
has
an
inherited
disease
-
is
advised
to
take
up
genetic
testing

however
,
-
public
is
very
concern
about
the
safe   Vform
operation
of
nuclear
reactors

in
order
to
make
engineering
design
product
meet
the
needs
,
first
of
all
,
-
clear
and
unambiguous   Wci
definition
of
this
problem
should
be
defined

their
focus
,
instead
,
is
directed
at
their
routine   Wci
occupational
job
and
their
own
family
matters
and
therefore
,
the
element
of
creative
is
not
part
of
their
daily
life

robbers
can
identify   Rloc-
rich
person
just
by
reading
the
rfid
tag
on
the
things
the
person
buys

therefore
the
solution
was
specified
and
the
design
process
was
nearing   Wci
completion

this
could
be
a
serious
security
flaw   Vt
;
in
case
the
plutonium
is
stolen
it
could
be
used
to
fuel
nuclear
weapons

in
addition
,
-
aging
population
has
not
been
an
area
of
concern
in
the
past
and
only   Cit
recently
the
aged
have
formed
a
significant
population
in
developed
countries

a
lot
of
money
is
also
spent
on
developing
these
technologies
which
are
still
in
experimental   Vt
stage

it
is
well-known
that
the
world
is
facing
a
growing
aging
population
and
this
trend
is
unlikely
to
be
reserved
in
the
short   Vt
term

therefore
,
they
might   Nn
turn
to
counterfeit
product
that
may
even
cause
more
harm
to
their
body

also
,
msr
will
be
using
thorium
as
fuel
where
thorium
is
so
abundant
in
the
world
as
compare
to
current
technologies
which
mostly
use
coals
as
fuel
where
coals
are
expected
to
last   Nn
just
for
another
146years
according
to

(

during
a
design
process
,
designers
do
not
focus
on
human
response
to
the
design
and
there
is
frequent   Wci
mismatch
between
the
operators
and
the
designed
machines
(
wilpert
,
2007
)

in
the
event
of
an
explosion
,
these
products
will
dissipate   Mec
into
the
surrounding

therefore
,
the
governments
are
funding
for
many
realistic
researches
and
technologies
to
weigh
down
the
deadweigh   Wci
loss
of
aging
process

health
care
policies
for
the
aged
have
been   Nn
getting
numerous
of
notice
in
the
recent
few
years

diverting
funds
to
other
areas
can
be
regarded
as
a
better
``
investment
''
by
policy   ArtOrDet
makers
and
would
aid
in
the
country
's
development

surveillance
technology
allow
others
to
monitor
our
daily
activities
and
record
these
data
in
the
form
of
cctv
(
closed-circuit   Wci
television
)
images
,
communication
records
and
content
enabling
them
to
have
access
to
our
personal
information

for
vhtr
,
the
projected
cost
of
building
a
prototype
of
the

reactor
is
around
$
1.1   Wci
billion
(
butler

)

although
the
whole
process
of
making
the
car
is
very   Others
tough
,
the
engineers
were
supported
by
company
,
government
,
and
society
all
the
way

it
is
so
important
that
innovation
design
should
be
existing   Um
anywhere

therefore
,
coming
up
with
scrubbers
and
nitrogen   Wci
oxide
control
devices
that
are
more
cost
and
control
efficient
will
definitely
reduce
a
significant
amount
of
pollutants
emission

hopefully
,
the
engineering
design
processes
can
be
further
polished
in
a
short   Vt
term
so
as
to
return
engineering
designs
with
higher
quality

removing
individual
's
control
over
the
results
will
in
turn
lead
to
freely   Wci
accessible
genetic
information
,
causing
social
issues
and
family
dilemma

giving
everyone
-
pension
means
that
some
people
's
living
standard
will
be
influenced
but
giving
out
money
based
on
the
fanatical
need
means
everyone
can
live
in
a
good   Vt
condition

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
should
be
used
to
track
people
since
it
helps
-
in
deterring   Rloc-
crimes
and
terrorism
,
monitoring
employees
and
improving
welfare
of
patients

with
the
currently   Nn

are
able
to

prevent

more

let
take
a
look
in
singapore
-
policies   Wform
nowadays

in
addition
,
the
implementation
of
``
wellness   Wci
program
''
and
policies
to
create
age-friendly
environment
also
help
in
buffering
the
aging
process

even
if
the
elderly
can
support
themselves
,
some
may
argue
that
-
they
pay
taxes
and
should
be
allowed
to
use
these
funds   Vt
set
aside
for
them

different
countries
have
different
cases
that
can
not
be
talked   Nn
together

one
current
human
need
that
should
be
given
priority
for
engineering
design
is
to
have
cost
saving   Wci
electronics

on
the
other
hand
,
for
the
nus   Wci
haptic
chair
innovation
process
,
the
researchers
had
successfully
developed
the
chair
for
the
convenience
of
the
deaf
people
in
singapore

therefore
,
if
the
government
are
about
to
limit
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
a
lot
of
-
young   Npos
and
elderly
will
suffer

from
fighting
for
independent

to
paving
the
way
for
our
generation   Vt
today
to
live
in

,
their

are
immeasurable

on
the
other
hand
,
the
development
of
society
calls
for
larger   ArtOrDet
and
larger   ArtOrDet

which
makes

were
the
ones
who
stimulated
the

and
awareness
of
these

(

however
,
more
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
the
development
of
social
policy
helping
to
alleviate
and
address   Vt
concerns
such
as
the
lack
of
financial
support
and
social

,
as
it
affects

military
priority
during

an
important
factor
in

this
two
tier   ArtOrDet
solution
would
definitely
help
in
the
progress
of
a
country

under
this
act
,
it
prohibits   Wci

from
making
unfavourable

and
prohibits   Wci
insurance
companies
from
reducing

the
extent
to
which
limitations
of
public
spending
on
the

has
always
been
a
complicated   ArtOrDet
issue
in
many
developed
countries

this
has
resulted
in
very
different
products
-
developed
by
each   Prep
environment

despite
the
above   Nn
said
,
it
may
be
objected
that
as
the
elderly
had
contributed
significantly
to
the
country
's
development
in
their
younger
days
,
in
view
of
their
long
term
hard
work
,
they
should
be
entitled
with
more
benefits
than
the
rest
of
the
population

therefore
,
emotional   Vt
reactions
of
relatives
or
parents
are
unpredicted
and
it
depends
on
the
believed
and
mindset
of
relatives
or
parents
of
individuals

even
for
the
same
kind
of
material
,
it
might
have
to
be
used
several
times
as
the
parts   Wci
fabricated
is
not
necessarily
always
in
the
expected
condition
when
it
is
first
made
,
resulting
in
a
wastage
and
hence
greater
consumption
of
raw
materials
and
therefore
a
greater
cost
incurred
in
the
designing
process

secondly
,
there
are
laws
such
as
-
genetic

non-discrimination
act
(

or

the
engineers

in
local   Wci
universities
are
not
able
to
fill
the
gap
left
by
the
engineers
who
leave
the

an
example
is
that
there
has
been   Nn
quite
a
number
research
on
the
kind
of
food
which
one
consumes
-
will
help
to
slow
the

at
the
same   Cit
time
,
more
and
more

are
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of

besides
,
such
costs
may
even
be
bigger
than
the
original
cost
of
running
welfare   Vt
programs
for
the
elderly

among
the
five   Wci
senses
,
the
most
common
deteriorations
of
senses
are
-
vision
problems
and
hearing
loss

hence
,
the
idea
of
spying
people
by
using
technology
such
as
rfid   Srun
has
to
be
banned

one
such   WOadv
example
is
the
healthcare
need
of
the
elderly

for
instance
-
free   Wci
personal
care
,
such
as
the
washing
and
dressing
of
elderly
people
costs
britain
an
additional
forty
million
pounds
which
caused
its
government
to
adopt
such
policy.2

while
it
is
important
to
care
for
the
aged
,
it
-
is
just
as
important
to
take
into
consideration
and
not
neglect
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development

that
is
,
both
are
largely   Nn
successful

all
the
alternative
energy
-
mentioned
are
green   Vt
compared
to
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
in
terms
of
emission
to
-
environment

the
two
main   Mec
causes
for
this
problem
are
population
outburst
and
corruption

in
north   Wci
korea
's
case
,
they
started
the
development
of
nuclear
technology
because
of
the
raise
of
tension
with
south
korea

basically
,
families
that
give
birth
to
more
than
one
child   Vt
will
get
economic
support
from
child   Vt
birth
rate
and
ease
the
ageing
process

this
brings
up
the
efficiency
of
the
reactor
by
as
much
as
50
-
percent
(
hecht
,
2008   Trans
)

in
fact
,
governments
should
only   Cit
focus
on
those
elderly
who
are
poor
,
needy
and
abandoned
by
family

hence
,
local
engineers
encounter
their
first
major
test
in
their
quest
:
limited
land   Um
spaces

there
are
plans
to
scale
up
the

by

electric
generated   Vt
vehicle
will
not
exhaust
gases
when
it
is
being

the
success
of
a
technology
not
only
depends
on
how
well
it
resolves
the
targeted
need
but
also
the
social
considerations
it
incurs   Nn
when
-
introduced
to
the
consumer
market

for
example
,
when
the
families
have
an
average
of
one
child   Vt
instead
of
two
or
three
children
,
the
only
child   Vt
will
have
a
very
huge
task
and
burden
to
take
care
of
his
or
her
family
in
the
future

despite
the
concern
by
the
public
over
the
safe
operation
of
the
nuclear
reactors
being
built
,
there
is
strong   Nn
evidence
that
-
very-high-temperature
reactors
(
vhtr
)
,
one
of
the
six
generations
iv
nuclear
reactors
,
could
bring
positive
results
for
further
research
and

funding

so
economy
cost
became
a
big   SVA
concern

(

firstly
,
if
the
risk
is
due
to
family
medical   Rloc-
history
such
as
haemophilia
and
huntington
's

(

)
,
then
by
revealing
it
to
relatives
,
more
people
will
know
that
they
could
be
at
risk
too

public
spending
on

beside
the

,
there
are
also
sponsors
from
the

which
need

be
diverted
to

due
to

,
the

the

finally   Nn
led
to

plus
,
since
a

workers
with
different

,
their
skills
might
not
be
similar
or
adequate
enough
to
meet
with
the
requirement
of

jobs

they
should
be
given
every   Vt
right
to
receive
education
under
any
circumstances

for
example
,
hand
phones
,
computers
,
mp3
and
cameras
have
make
communication
between
people
in
a
distant
more
easily   Nn
simply
just
by
a

or
a

in

however
,
genetic
information
of
an
individual
susceptible
to
a
particular   Vt
genetic
disease
inevitably
concerns
family
members
who
usually
also
share
the

of

therefore
,
the
research
in
msr
cost
about
$   Rloc-
1000
million
as
compared
to
vhtr
's

which

670

as
quoted
from
the

on

the

that

the

-

people
in

wealthier
and
better

so
the
technology
which
is
designed   Rloc-

will
draw
more
attention

the
driver
,
nevertheless
,
chose
to
ignore
the

until

we
should
only

in
this

the

of

are
attention-getting
because
the
